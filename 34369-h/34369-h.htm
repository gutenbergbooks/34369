<br />A Valuable Letter</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Susan! We have only ten minutes
before the store closes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penelope Nichols, the slender girl
in blue, urged her companion into the revolving
doors at the entrance of the Bresham Department
Store. A vigorous push sent the barriers
spinning at such a rate that other shoppers
turned to stare at the two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You nearly took off my heels that time,
Penny,&rdquo; Susan Altman protested with a laugh as
they emerged into the crowded store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but we&rsquo;ve no time to waste if I get that
pair of white earrings. The clerks are starting
to put things away already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Threading their way through the outgoing
stream of shoppers, the girls went directly to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
jewelry counter. Penny peered anxiously into
one of the glass cases to see if the coveted ivory
ornaments were still on display. They had not
been sold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll look all right with my
red party frock?&rdquo; she asked her chum as they
stood impatiently waiting for a clerk. In matters
of dress she valued Susan&rsquo;s opinion more
highly than her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stunning. With your coloring you can wear
anything. Now if you had a skin like mine and
a snub nose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not hear the remainder of her
chum&rsquo;s oft-repeated complaint for she was trying
vainly to attract the attention of a clerk.
The only available girl at the counter was occupied
in showing a tray of fine rings to a tall
man in gray tweeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never be waited on,&rdquo; Penny murmured
in annoyance. &ldquo;You can tell it&rsquo;s going
to take until closing time before he makes up his
mind which ring he wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan turned to survey the customer. He was
expensively dressed and upon a casual inspection
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
appeared to be a gentleman of considerable
means. Although the clerk offered several
diamond rings for his approval none of them
satisfied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you anything better than this?&rdquo; he
questioned. &ldquo;Show me that large diamond,
please.&rdquo; He tapped the glass case lightly with
his cane.</p>
<p>The clerk obligingly placed the ring before
him. The man examined the diamond closely,
comparing it with another ring previously
shown him. For the first time he appeared
aware of Penny and Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait on these young ladies while I make up
my mind which ring I prefer,&rdquo; he urged the
clerk. &ldquo;I am in no hurry and I can see that
they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk hesitated. The rings in which the
customer was interested were valuable ones. It
was a rule of the store to keep them always in
the locked case. Yet it would take her only a
minute to wait upon the girls, and obviously
the man was a gentleman. She turned to serve
Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that pair of earrings,&rdquo; Penny announced,
indicating the ivory pieces. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
three dollars, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is correct. I&rsquo;ll have them wrapped
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny offered the girl a five dollar bill in
payment. She could not restrain a little sigh
as she saw it deposited in the store&rsquo;s cash drawer.
Perhaps she had been foolish to buy the earrings.
It meant that she must do without a
great many little things in order to keep within
her allowance. Penny sighed again. At times
it was trying to have a father who believed in
maintaining his daughter strictly upon a
budget plan.</p>
<p>Her eyes roved aimlessly toward the man at
the ring counter. She saw him cast a quick
glance about. Then he walked rapidly away,
making for the nearest exit.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s keen blue eyes riveted upon the ring
tray. The large diamond was missing.</p>
<p>She had not seen the customer actually take
it&mdash;his movements had been too deft for that&mdash;yet
she knew for a certainty that while the
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
clerk&rsquo;s back had been turned he had secreted it
somewhere upon his person.</p>
<p>Penny did not hesitate. She darted after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cried. And then to the surprised
shoppers who turned at the sound of her voice:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that thief get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man wheeled sharply, his face convulsed
in anger. With his cane he struck viciously at
a stout woman who clutched him by the coat.</p>
<p>A store detective blocked the main exit.</p>
<p>Recognizing that he could not hope to escape
that way, the thief turned and bolted up a moving
escalator which was carrying a capacity load
of passengers to the second floor.</p>
<p>Penny, the detective, and a few of the more
energetic customers took up the pursuit.</p>
<p>In a desperate attempt to escape, the thief
elbowed women roughly aside as he darted up
the stairway. Upon the uncertain footing of
the moving treads, several stumbled and fell.
In an instant hysterical women were screaming
and clutching at one another for support.</p>
<p>A slender girl in a shabby business suit was
rudely jostled. Penny, half way up the moving
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
stairway, tried to save her from a hard fall. She
was not quick enough. Down the girl went,
and as she fell, the contents of her pocketbook
spilled out upon the moving stairway. The
thief took advantage of the resulting confusion
to melt into the throng of shoppers at the top of
the escalator. While store detectives carried on
the pursuit, Penny tried to help the terrified
women to alight from the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; she asked the girl who had
fallen, trying to assist her to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind me! Save my pocketbook!&rdquo; the
other cried, frantically beginning to gather up
the scattered objects.</p>
<p>The other passengers upon the stairway were
more of a hindrance than a help. Yet by working
fast Penny managed to accumulate nearly
all of the lost articles before the brief ride approached
its end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My letter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the other girl&rsquo;s shrill cry, Penny saw a
white envelope riding serenely on the uppermost
step. With a bound she covered the distance
which separated her from it, pouncing
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
upon the letter an instant before the moving
belt disappeared into the flooring.</p>
<p>Clutching it triumphantly in her hand, she
turned to assist the girl who had lost it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re limping,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;Here,
lean on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; the girl maintained staunchly.
&ldquo;I twisted my ankle when I fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny helped her to a nearby chair. Despite
the girl&rsquo;s brave words, her lips quivered when
she spoke and her attractive face had taken on
an ashen hue. Yet, strangely, her interest
centered not in her injury but in the letter
which she had nearly lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for saving it,&rdquo; she told Penny
gratefully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I should have
done if I&rsquo;d lost that letter. It means everything
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stared at the envelope a trifle curiously
but she was too well bred to ask personal questions.
Before she could make any response
store officials hurried up to take charge of the
situation. The girl&rsquo;s name was Rosanna Winters,
Penny learned, by listening. She lived at a
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
rooming house on Sixty-fifth Street, not a great
distance from Penny&rsquo;s own home.</p>
<p>Rosanna firmly turned down the suggestion
of store officials that she be sent to a nearby hospital
for first-aid treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary. I merely twisted my ankle.
I&rsquo;ll soon be able to walk on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take you home,&rdquo; Penny offered.
&ldquo;My roadster is parked just outside the store.
We live close to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl hesitated, then smiled as she said:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure. You don&rsquo;t
really mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Here, let me help you downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by way of the escalator,&rdquo; Rosanna said
hastily. &ldquo;Hereafter I&rsquo;ll ride on the elevator.
It&rsquo;s safer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the store&rsquo;s gong had announced the
closing hour some minutes previously, shoppers
were slow to leave the building. As the girls
returned to the street floor they were embarrassed
to find themselves the target for many
curious stares. Penny readily was recognized
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
as the girl who had observed the theft of the
ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of that man who knocked me
down?&rdquo; Rosanna questioned. &ldquo;I suppose he
escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; Penny admitted, looking
about for Susan. &ldquo;The last I saw of him he was
running toward the kitchenware department
with the store detective after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sighting Susan near the outside door, Penny
steered her new friend in that direction.
Quickly she introduced the girls, mentioning
Rosanna&rsquo;s unfortunate accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it all,&rdquo; Susan declared. &ldquo;Penny, you
certainly did stir up things when you set the
store detective on that thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the worst of it was that he escaped,&rdquo;
Penny acknowledged. &ldquo;Of course, he may be
caught here in the building but I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the excitement, she had completely forgotten
her package at the jewelry counter. The
girls would have left the store without it had
not the clerk come running after them with the
purchase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much for calling out the
alarm,&rdquo; she told Penny gratefully. &ldquo;If the thief
isn&rsquo;t caught I may lose my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have broken a store
rule. I was completely taken in by the man&rsquo;s
appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at that,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;He
certainly looked anything but a crook. Was the
ring a valuable one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was priced to sell at eight hundred dollars.
I don&rsquo;t see how I could have been so stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny felt sorry for the salesgirl, particularly
so when the floorwalker came up and began to
question her sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really wasn&rsquo;t the clerk&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; Penny
insisted. &ldquo;I feel certain that man was a professional
jewel thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice his appearance?&rdquo; the floorwalker
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was dressed in a gray tweed suit. I&rsquo;d
say he was approximately six feet in height,
dark hair and eyes. His face was long and
angular.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>The store official noted down the description
and took Penny&rsquo;s address in case she might be
needed later on to identify the crook if he were
captured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re watching all the lower floor exits,&rdquo;
the floorwalker informed, &ldquo;but the chances are
the man got away by means of one of the fire
escapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The store rapidly was clearing of shoppers.
Penny and her companions lingered a few minutes
longer and then they too were politely requested
to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know if the store detective caught
that man,&rdquo; Penny declared as they paused for
an instant on the street. &ldquo;I suppose now we&rsquo;ll
have to find out by reading our newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna Winters turned as if to leave the
girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you again for saving my pocketbook,&rdquo;
she said to Penny. &ldquo;My ankle is much better
now so I&rsquo;ll just take a streetcar home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny caught her by the elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such thing. Why, I can see
that it hurts you every step you take. It isn&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
more than a block or two out of my way to drive
you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite Rosanna&rsquo;s protests, she urged the girl
into the roadster which was parked at the curbing.
Penny was very proud of her car. Although
it was not a new model it ran very well and
she spent most of her spare time keeping it
washed and polished.</p>
<p>Since the Altman residence was close by,
Penny dropped her chum off before taking
Rosanna home. During the ride to Sixty-fifth
Street, the Winters girl spoke scarcely a word.
Several times Penny cast a curious glance in her
direction.</p>
<p>Rosanna was the quiet type, she decided. A
striking brunette with a thoughtful, almost sad
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live at the next house,&rdquo; the girl said as they
turned a corner. &ldquo;The one on the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a modest but not unattractive boarding
house. The porch was clean and the yard
more orderly than the majority in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only staying here a few days until I can
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
find another place,&rdquo; Rosanna mentioned, feeling
that some explanation was due her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a stranger in Belton City?&rdquo; Penny
guessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I came here looking for work. But now
that won&rsquo;t be necessary.&rdquo; Rosanna hesitated,
and then, because Penny had seemed so very
friendly, decided to offer additional information.
&ldquo;I am an orphan, Miss Nichols. Until
this week I had begun to think that fortune had
turned against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ve had a piece of good luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rosanna&rsquo;s face glowed as she opened
her purse and took out the letter which Penny
had picked up from the escalator. &ldquo;If you
hadn&rsquo;t saved this for me, I should have lost
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m glad I snatched it up in time,&rdquo;
Penny smiled.</p>
<p>She could not imagine the contents of the
mysterious letter. It was all she could do to
keep from asking questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have you read it if you care to,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Rosanna said a trifle timidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to
learn the opinion of another person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll be glad to look at it if you wish,&rdquo;
Penny returned, a little surprised at the request.
&ldquo;And as far as advice is concerned, I love to
offer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She accepted the envelope which Rosanna
proffered. As she took out the folded letter a
key dropped out into her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Penny demanded.</p>
<p>Rosanna laughed nervously. &ldquo;If what the
letter says is true, it seems to be the key to my
inheritance! But read the letter for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />A Mysterious Key</h2>
<p>Unfolding the paper, Penny noticed
that the message had been written
under the letterhead: &ldquo;J.C. Elfhedge,
attorney, Brookport.&rdquo; The communication
stated briefly that Rosanna Winters was the sole
heiress of the late Jacob Winters, her uncle, and
that she had inherited his mountainside estate
at Raven Ridge. A key to the property was enclosed.
She was urged to inspect the estate at
her earliest convenience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rdquo; Rosanna
questioned as Penny studied the letter in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Penny returned after a slight
hesitation. &ldquo;Did you know Jacob Winters
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know him at all. In fact I never
even met him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Then the inheritance must have come
as a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It did. Even now I can&rsquo;t help thinking there
must be some mistake. Did you ever hear of
Raven Ridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Penny told her. &ldquo;It is a lovely
spot near Snow Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go there as soon as I can,&rdquo; Rosanna
said. &ldquo;Will the car fare be very much do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not more than ten dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a large sum for me,&rdquo; Rosanna smiled
ruefully. &ldquo;Of course, now that I&rsquo;ve actually inherited
Uncle Jacob&rsquo;s estate, I suppose I
shouldn&rsquo;t worry about money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t spend lavishly until I was
certain there would be no slip-up about getting
the property,&rdquo; Penny advised bluntly. &ldquo;Perhaps
I shouldn&rsquo;t say it, but there&rsquo;s a certain tone
to this letter that I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Rosanna questioned.</p>
<p>Penny found it difficult to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brookport is only a few miles from here and
yet I&rsquo;ve never heard of a lawyer by the name of
Elfhedge. It seems a trifle strange too that he
should enclose a key to the property.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It struck me that way too at first,&rdquo; Rosanna
admitted unwillingly. &ldquo;Of course, I do have an
uncle named Jacob Winters&mdash;my mother often
spoke of him. He was always considered
queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be all right. No doubt you have inherited
a fortune. Only I think I&rsquo;d be a trifle
cautious until I was certain it wasn&rsquo;t a hoax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can I do except to obey the letter
and visit the property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced again at the letterhead. &ldquo;Why
not visit this lawyer and have a talk with him?
Brookport isn&rsquo;t far from here and it might save
you a trip to Raven Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I reach Brookport by train or bus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s off the
main line of travel. You haven&rsquo;t a car of your
own or one you could borrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to Brookport if you like,&rdquo;
Penny offered generously. &ldquo;We might go tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t like to trouble you, Miss
Nichols. I can probably rent a car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of it for I would enjoy the
ride. Besides, I am curious to learn if there is
an attorney by the name of Elfhedge living in
Brookport. Suppose I call here for you around
ten o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Rosanna smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of
you to offer. Perhaps I can repay you someday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls parted, Penny driving directly to
her own home. Entering the house by the back
door she found Mrs. Gallup, the housekeeper,
cooking dinner. The kitchen was permeated
with the delightful aroma of frying chicken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Dad home yet?&rdquo; Penny inquired, pausing
to sniff the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the study,&rdquo; the housekeeper informed.</p>
<p>Penny found Christopher Nichols occupied
at his desk. Sometimes it was difficult for her to
realize that she was the daughter of a detective
who had gained state-wide recognition for his
ability in solving baffling cases. Mr. Nichols
had served an apprenticeship on the police
force, had risen from the ranks, and later had
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
started his own private detective agency. Yet,
despite his success, he was quiet and unaffected.</p>
<p>Mr. Nichols had no real hobbies and only two
absorbing interests in life&mdash;his work and his
daughter. Penny had been left motherless at
an early age. Because there had been only a
slight feminine influence in her life her outlook
upon the world was somewhat different from
that of the average high school girl. She thought
clearly and frankly spoke her mind. Yet if she
enjoyed an unusual amount of freedom for one
so young, she never abused the trust which her
father placed in her.</p>
<p>Penny loved adventure. Recently, somewhat
to her father&rsquo;s chagrin, she had involved herself
with a daring gang of automobile thieves. The
story of her exciting encounter with underworld
characters has been recounted in the first
volume of the series, entitled, &ldquo;Penny Nichols
Finds A Clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; Mr. Nichols demanded gruffly
as his daughter perched herself on the corner
of his desk. &ldquo;Has that car of yours broken down
again?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Penny laughed as she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, believe it or not, I still have a few dollars
of my allowance left. I&rsquo;m after information
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preferably accurate,&rdquo; Penny smiled. &ldquo;Tell
me, did you ever hear of a lawyer by the name of
Elfhedge with an office at Brookport?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never did,&rdquo; Mr. Nichols returned instantly.
&ldquo;There is an attorney in the Stover
building by the name of Hedgel. Perhaps
you&rsquo;re mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the name right,&rdquo; Penny insisted. She
then related the contents of Rosanna Winters&rsquo;
letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like someone&rsquo;s idea of a practical
joke,&rdquo; Mr. Nichols declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise the
girl not to spend any money until she&rsquo;s done a
little investigating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I did tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look this man Elfhedge up in a day or two
if you like,&rdquo; Mr. Nichols promised. &ldquo;It sounds
like a fictitious name to me but of course the
letter may be <i>bona fide</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Mrs. Gallup interrupted the discussion to
announce that dinner was ready. Immediately
after the meal had been served, Mr. Nichols left
for his office and Penny saw him no more that
evening. He left the house before she was up
the next morning so she had no opportunity to
explain that she was driving Rosanna Winters
to Brookport that day.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock she rang the doorbell of the
rooming house on Sixty-fifth Street. Rosanna
already was waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might have changed your
mind about wishing to make the trip,&rdquo; she declared,
following Penny to the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m more curious than ever to talk with
your lawyer. It will be wonderful, Rosanna, if
the estate turns out to be a valuable one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna smiled a trifle ruefully. &ldquo;Yes, I will
have plenty of use for the money. I can&rsquo;t believe
yet that Uncle Jacob left everything to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny refrained from saying anything which
might disturb Rosanna. Actually, she had not
the slightest reason for doubting that the girl
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
had come into an inheritance, save that the letter
from Mr. Elfhedge did not have a genuine
tone. It occurred to her that a scheme might
be under way to induce the orphan to part with
her own savings.</p>
<p>During the ride to Brookport, Rosanna mentioned
a few of the hard experiences she had
undergone in the past year. First her mother
had died, then an aunt with whom she made her
home, likewise had been taken from her. She
found work of a sort in a grocery store, but long
hours and trying conditions had worn her down.
She had taken sick. Hospital bills claimed the
greater part of the money which her mother had
left her. She could not secure her old job back,
nor could she find a new one. In desperation
she had decided to come to Belton City, hoping
that she might secure a position there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can imagine that I was pretty well discouraged
when the letter arrived from Mr. Elfhedge,&rdquo;
Rosanna ended. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
what a fright you gave me by suggesting that it
might be a hoax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I caused you worry. I had no
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
reason for thinking that someone wrote the letter
for a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Jacob was noted for doing queer
things,&rdquo; Rosanna informed. &ldquo;I never met him
but Mother often mentioned his name. He
was quite a traveler, I believe, and collecting
was his hobby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he collect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, things from the Orient and antiques
from all over the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you&rsquo;ve come into his property, you
may have inherited some real treasures,&rdquo; Penny
commented. &ldquo;It would be fun to visit that
house at Raven Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I dread going there alone. Penny,
I wish you could go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could too, but I guess I&rsquo;ll have to
stay at Belton City this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only a little after eleven o&rsquo;clock when
the girls reached Brookport. The town was
less than a hundred thousand population and
Penny had no trouble in finding the main business
section. After cruising about for some
minutes, they located the street where Mr. Elfhedge
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
had his office. The number which they
sought brought them to an imposing seven-story
brick building.</p>
<p>Penny parked the roadster and they went inside,
searching the directory for Mr. Elfhedge&rsquo;s
name. It was not listed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; Rosanna remarked with a
troubled frown. &ldquo;His office must be here somewhere
in the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went over to make inquiry of the elevator
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one in this building by that
name,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>Thinking that the boy might be misinformed,
Penny and Rosanna sought the building superintendent.
To satisfy them, the man looked
carefully through his list of tenants. No one by
the name of Elfhedge occupied an office in the
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an attorney in Room 309 but his
name is Rogers,&rdquo; the superintendent told the
girls. &ldquo;You might talk with him. He may
know this man Elfhedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went up to Room 309 and after a brief
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
wait were ushered into the lawyer&rsquo;s private office.
Rosanna was too shy to state the purpose
of her visit, so Penny explained why they had
come. The lawyer had never heard of a colleague
by the name of Elfhedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s never been in this building and I doubt
that he&rsquo;s even located in the city,&rdquo; they were
told. &ldquo;You must have made a mistake in the
address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had made no mistake, that they
knew. The address was plainly written on the
outside of the envelope which Rosanna had in
her purse. She showed it to the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that seems to be this building,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;It looks as if someone used a fake
address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the office completely discouraged.
Penny felt sorry for her companion. Rosanna
had counted so heavily upon the inheritance.
Now it appeared that someone had played a
cruel joke upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; Rosanna acknowledged as
they walked slowly back to the car. &ldquo;You were
suspicious of that letter from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It struck me as peculiar that it was written in
longhand instead of on a typewriter,&rdquo; Penny
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is nothing but a joke,&rdquo; Rosanna
acknowledged, &ldquo;and yet why should a key be
enclosed in the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond me, Rosanna. Even if the trip
is wasted, you might feel better about it if you
went to Raven Ridge and investigated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go in an instant if I had the money to
spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll loan it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t take it although it&rsquo;s kind of you
to offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could help you, Rosanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve helped me a great deal already. Perhaps
a little later on I&rsquo;ll find some way of getting
to Raven Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tried to urge the loan, but Rosanna,
who was unusually proud, would not hear of it.
The girls parted at the latter&rsquo;s boarding house
on Sixty-fifth Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you within a day or two,&rdquo; Penny
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
promised as she drove away. &ldquo;Perhaps by that
time Father will learn something about Mr.
Elfhedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not really believe that Mr. Nichols
could find anything to report. Doubtless, the
name had been a fictitious one. Yet who had
played the joke upon Rosanna and for what
purpose?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to the affair than what appears
on the surface,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;If only I had the
chance, I&rsquo;d do a little investigating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny smiled at the thought, little dreaming
that such an opportunity was to present itself
very shortly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />An Arrogant Guest</h2>
<p>That evening at the dinner table Penny
told her father about the unsuccessful
trip to Brookport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like someone played a practical joke
on your friend,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who could be so mean, Dad? Rosanna
has had such a desperately hard time to get
along. Now if she wastes money going to Raven
Ridge on a fruitless visit, it won&rsquo;t seem fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s likely to amount to just that,&rdquo;
Mr. Nichols returned. &ldquo;I tried to locate that
attorney, Elfhedge today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I doubt if such a person exists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Penny agreed. &ldquo;By the way, what
became of the newspaper today? I wanted to
read up about the department store theft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see if your name was mentioned?&rdquo; her
father teased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was just curious to learn if the thief
was captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can set your mind at rest on that point,&rdquo;
Mr. Nichols informed. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re
interested in the details, you&rsquo;ll find the paper on
the front porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny helped Mrs. Gallup clear the table of
dishes, then went outside to get the paper. The
story appeared on the front page. It was a
slightly distorted version of what had happened
and Penny was just as well pleased that her
name was not mentioned. According to the account,
the thief had escaped by means of a rear
fire escape. The ring, valued at approximately
nine hundred dollars, was fully covered by insurance.</p>
<p>While Penny was reading the story, Mr.
Nichols came out and sat on the porch steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to take a little trip?&rdquo; he
asked casually.</p>
<p>Penny dropped the newspaper. &ldquo;With you?&rdquo;
she questioned eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been working hard lately and I feel
like taking a rest over the week end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where will we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of Mt. Ashland. It will be cool
in the mountains and at this time of year the
hotels will not be too crowded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mt. Ashland isn&rsquo;t very far from Snow
Mountain, is it?&rdquo; Penny demanded with interest.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to look it up on the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran into the house for the big red atlas.
A moment later she returned, her eyes dancing
with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mt. Ashland isn&rsquo;t more than a two hours&rsquo;
drive from Snow Mountain,&rdquo; she told her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just what difference does it make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Raven Ridge is located on Snow
Mountain, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So that&rsquo;s what you have in your mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny perched herself on her father&rsquo;s knee,
smiling her most beguiling smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, you little tease,&rdquo; he said hastily.
&ldquo;I give in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know what I want,&rdquo; she
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. You want to take this new friend
of yours along with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be nice, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Penny
beamed. &ldquo;Then while you&rsquo;re having a good
rest at Mt. Ashland we could drive on to Raven
Ridge. Rosanna could investigate her property
there, if she has any, and it wouldn&rsquo;t cost her
much of anything to make the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have it well planned,&rdquo; the detective
marveled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s wrong with the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. We&rsquo;ll take her along if she wants
to go. She may help keep you out of mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; Penny demanded gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow afternoon as soon as I can get
away from the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll dash over to see Rosanna now and
ask if she can go with us,&rdquo; Penny announced.</p>
<p>Without giving her father an opportunity to
change his mind, she hurried to the garage for
her roadster. At the rooming house on Sixty-fifth
Street, the landlady, a stout woman with
a tired, lined face, admitted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Winters has the attic room,&rdquo; she informed.
&ldquo;Five flights up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the top of the last flight Penny paused to
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
catch her breath before rapping on Rosanna&rsquo;s
door. The orphan was a trifle startled at seeing
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come in,&rdquo; she said cordially.</p>
<p>The room was oppressive and warm, although
the tiny windows were open wide. A bed, a
chest of drawers, two chairs and a cracked
mirror composed the entire furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to stay here long,&rdquo; Rosanna
said apologetically. &ldquo;I thought it would do
until I found work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; Penny agreed instantly.
&ldquo;Did you have any luck today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna shook her head and sank wearily
down upon the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, everywhere I went it was the same old
story. I&rsquo;m beginning to think I&rsquo;ll never find
employment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll not need it if you come into
an inheritance,&rdquo; Penny smiled. &ldquo;Rosanna, I&rsquo;ve
found a way for you to get to Raven Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orphan&rsquo;s face brightened but for a full
minute after Penny had explained the plan, she
sat silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to go?&rdquo; Penny asked, perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I do. It isn&rsquo;t that. You&rsquo;ve
been so good and kind to me. I&rsquo;ll never be able
to repay you for your trouble and expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! The trip will be more fun if you
go along, Rosanna. Besides, I have an overwhelming
curiosity to see Raven Ridge and
your uncle&rsquo;s estate. Please say you&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will,&rdquo; Rosanna gave in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Father and I will stop for you tomorrow.
I must get back home now and start
packing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny clattered down the creaking, narrow
stairway and disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>Although the trip was only a short one, and
at the longest would occupy less than a week&rsquo;s
time, Penny spent many hours planning her
wardrobe. She packed an evening gown, several
afternoon frocks, and sports clothes. Then,
reflecting that Rosanna would not be so well
fixed, she hung the garments back in the closet,
substituting her plainest dresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that will be much better,&rdquo; she
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
decided. &ldquo;A wise traveler goes light anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock the following afternoon,
Penny and her father stopped at Rosanna&rsquo;s
rooming house to pick up the orphan. She was
waiting on the porch, and as Penny had thought,
confined her luggage to one overnight bag.</p>
<p>At first the road to Mt. Ashland wound
through fertile valleys and low hills. Gradually,
they climbed. The curves became more frequent.
Tall pines bordered the roadside.</p>
<p>Six o&rsquo;clock found the party well into the
mountains, although still some miles from their
destination. Noticing a pleasant little inn at the
top of a ridge, they stopped for dinner which
was served on the veranda overlooking a beautiful
valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Raven Ridge will be as pretty
as this?&rdquo; Rosanna mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s even more beautiful,&rdquo; Mr. Nichols told
her. &ldquo;The scenery is very impressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they arose from the table it was growing
dusk for they had lingered to watch the
sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well that I wired ahead for hotel
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
reservations,&rdquo; Mr. Nichols remarked as they
hurried to the parked car. &ldquo;Getting in after
dark it wouldn&rsquo;t be so pleasant to find all the
rooms taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At exactly nine o&rsquo;clock the twinkling lights
of the Mt. Ashland Hotel were sighted, and a
few minutes later the automobile drew up in
front of the large white rambling building. An
attendant took the car and they all went inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if you&rsquo;ll get rooms here tonight,
sir,&rdquo; a bellboy told the detective as he carried
the luggage to the main desk. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a
big rush of guests this week-end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Nichols was not disturbed. At the desk
he merely gave the clerk his name, claiming the
two rooms which he had reserved by wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saved two very fine rooms for you,&rdquo; the
clerk returned politely. &ldquo;Both overlook the
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Mr. Nichols signed the register, Penny
and Rosanna sat down nearby. Their attention
was drawn to the main entrance. A large touring
car had pulled up to the door. A pompous
looking woman of middle age and a younger
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
woman, evidently her daughter, had alighted.
Both were elegantly if somewhat conspicuously
dressed. Several suitcases, hat boxes and miscellaneous
packages were unloaded. The older
woman carried a fat lapdog in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to have brought everything but
the bird cage,&rdquo; Penny said in an undertone.</p>
<p>The two women walked up to the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Everett Leeds,&rdquo; the one with the
dog announced a trifle too loudly. &ldquo;I have a
reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute please,&rdquo; the clerk requested.</p>
<p>It seemed to Penny that he looked disturbed
as he thumbed through his cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no occasion for delay,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds
declared blandly. &ldquo;My daughter and I always
engage the same room&mdash;305.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that was the number of one of the
rooms assigned to my party,&rdquo; Mr. Nichols observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been some mix-up,&rdquo; the clerk said
in distress. He turned again to the two women.
&ldquo;Your reservation isn&rsquo;t on file, Mrs. Leeds.
When did you send the wire?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reserved the room by letter,&rdquo; the woman
informed him coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was never received here I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt the letter was lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are certain it was sent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds declared icily.
&ldquo;My daughter mailed it. Didn&rsquo;t you, Alicia,
my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A queer expression passed over the girl&rsquo;s face.
It struck Penny that she probably had forgotten
to post the letter. However, Alicia staunchly
maintained that she had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most provoking that you have misplaced
the reservation,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds said irritably to
the clerk. &ldquo;But of course we can have the
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that is impossible, Mrs. Leeds.
The room you wanted was reserved for two
young ladies.&rdquo; With a nod of his head the clerk
indicated Penny and Rosanna.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds and her daughter turned to stare
somewhat haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other room can you give us then?&rdquo; the
woman demanded angrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>The clerk cast Mr. Nichols a despairing
glance. He knew he was in for trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically everything is taken, Mrs. Leeds.
In fact the only available room is on the top
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you expect us to take that?&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds
cried, her voice rising until everyone in the
lobby could hear. &ldquo;I never heard of such outrageous
treatment. Call the manager!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had risen to her feet. She moved
quickly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to do that,&rdquo; she said pleasantly.
&ldquo;If Rosanna doesn&rsquo;t mind, I am perfectly
willing to exchange rooms with Mrs. Leeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; Rosanna agreed. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t matter to me where I sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satisfied at having her own way, Mrs. Leeds
quieted down. She even thanked the girls
graciously for the sacrifice they had made. The
clerk gave out the keys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; Mr. Nichols asked
gruffly as he and the girls followed a bellboy
to the elevator. &ldquo;Your room up by the roof will
be hot as blazes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but I didn&rsquo;t see any sense in making
such a fuss over a room, Dad. Besides, it&rsquo;s only
for one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d insist that you girls take my room if it had
a double bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you came here for a rest. Rosanna and
I really won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three entered the elevator and a minute
later Mrs. Leeds and her daughter likewise
stepped into the lift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you girls will not find it uncomfortable
on the top floor,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds remarked,
trying to make pleasant conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very warm tonight,&rdquo; Penny returned
politely. &ldquo;Besides, it will only be for one night.
We&rsquo;re going on to Raven Ridge in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator was whizzing them upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say Raven Ridge?&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds questioned
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A queer expression had come into Mrs. Leeds
sharp, blue eyes. She seemed on the verge of
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
speaking, then apparently changed her mind.</p>
<p>The elevator stopped at the third floor.
Without a word, the woman urged her daughter
out the door, following her down the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />A Face at the Window</h2>
<p>The little room on the top floor of the
hotel was as hot and unpleasant as Mr.
Nichols had predicted. Even with all
the windows open wide the air still seemed
close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosanna, I shouldn&rsquo;t have forced you into
this,&rdquo; Penny said apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve slept in far worse places than this,&rdquo;
Rosanna laughed. &ldquo;We have a comfortable
bed and a private bath. I didn&rsquo;t fare half so
well at Mrs. Bridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good sport anyway, Rosanna.
That&rsquo;s more than could be said for Mrs. Leeds
or her daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how old the girl is? She looked
about our age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d guess she was two or three years older,&rdquo;
Penny returned. &ldquo;She had so much paint on it
was hard to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Both girls were tired from the long day&rsquo;s drive.
Rosanna immediately began to undress. Penny
sat on the edge of the bed, thoughtfully staring
into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it strike you as queer the way Mrs. Leeds
acted when I mentioned we were going to Raven
Ridge tomorrow?&rdquo; she questioned her companion.</p>
<p>Rosanna kicked off her slippers before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come to think of it, she did look a little
startled. She put on such a scene downstairs
that I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably never see her again.&rdquo; With
a shrug of her slim shoulders Penny arose and
began to unpack her overnight bag.</p>
<p>According to the plan which they had worked
out with Mr. Nichols, the girls expected to leave
for Raven Ridge the next morning directly after
breakfast. It was their intention to motor to
the mountain resort, inspect the Winters&rsquo; property
and see if they could learn anything concerning
Rosanna&rsquo;s uncle. They intended to return
either the next night or the one following.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Few guests were abroad when the detective
joined the girls at breakfast. It was only a little
after seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep well?&rdquo; he inquired, looking over the
menu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; Penny admitted truthfully. She
might have added more had not Mrs. Leeds and
her daughter entered the dining room at that
moment. The two bowed slightly and selected
a table in the opposite corner of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Social climbers,&rdquo; Mr. Nichols said in an
undertone. &ldquo;I can tell their type a mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast finished, the girls prepared to leave
for Raven Ridge. Their bags were already
packed and downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now drive cautiously over the mountain
roads,&rdquo; the detective warned as he accompanied
the girls to the waiting car. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t get
back by evening send me a wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny took her place at the steering
wheel she observed that Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; automobile
had been brought to the hotel entrance by an
attendant. Apparently, she too was making an
early morning departure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not listening to a word I am saying!&rdquo;
Mr. Nichols said severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo; Penny&rsquo;s attention came back
to the conversation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive carefully and
deliver your precious car back to you without
a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t exactly worried about the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no need to be uneasy about
Rosanna or me. We&rsquo;ll have no trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a laugh of careless confidence, Penny
started the car and drove slowly away. It was
not the first time she had driven over mountainous
roads. She handled the wheel exceptionally
well and used due caution on all of the
sharp curves. The brakes were good but she
dared not apply them too steadily on the steep
inclines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to rush if we get back to Mt.
Ashland this evening,&rdquo; Penny announced, slowing
down to read a signpost. &ldquo;I declare, a mountain
mile seems to be three times the length of
an ordinary mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had gone only a short distance farther
when a tire went down. Penny knew it instantly
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
by the feel of the steering wheel. She
pulled off at the side of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are in it,&rdquo; she said in deep disgust.
&ldquo;At least ten miles from a garage. I can change
wheels on my own car, but I doubt if I can on
Dad&rsquo;s automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls waited for a few minutes hoping
that someone would come along to help. When
no one did, Penny dragged out the tools, and
after considerable trouble succeeded in jacking
up the rear axle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a car coming,&rdquo; Rosanna reported hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s flag it,&rdquo; Penny suggested. &ldquo;I could do
with a little masculine help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to her signal of distress, the approaching
automobile slowed down. The
driver was a man and there were no passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s stopping,&rdquo; Penny said in relief.</p>
<p>There was a screech of brakes as the automobile
came almost to a standstill. Then surprisingly,
it speeded up again. But not before
Penny had caught a fleeting glimpse of the
driver&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; Rosanna exclaimed indignantly.
&ldquo;I call that a mean trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he was afraid to stop,&rdquo; Penny announced
excitedly. &ldquo;I think I recognized him.
It was the same man who stole the ring from
Bresham&rsquo;s Department Store!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Rosanna demanded incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be absolutely certain, of course.
He was traveling too fast for me to catch more
than a passing glimpse of his face. But if he
didn&rsquo;t recognize us, why did he slow down and
then speed up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did act suspiciously. But what can we
do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I&rsquo;m afraid. We may as well devote
our energies to this wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna was more than eager to help but she
had never even seen a tire changed and had no
idea how to go about it. After a little annoying
experimentation, Penny got the wheel in place
and tightened the lugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; she said in relief, &ldquo;but
my dress is a mess. I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have to stop
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
at the first garage and have the old wheel fixed,
for I don&rsquo;t carry another spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A signpost at the next bend in the road advised
them that Simpson&rsquo;s Garage was located
only six miles away. They made it in a few
minutes. There was no town, only a post office,
one general store, and the garage which obviously
was a remodeled blacksmith shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s nothing more than a tire which
needs repairing,&rdquo; Penny commented as the garageman
came to learn what they wanted.</p>
<p>He promised that the tire would be ready in
half an hour. Glancing at her wrist watch,
Penny saw that it was already past lunch time.
She inquired if there was a cafe nearby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in Hamilton, there ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the garageman
told her. &ldquo;Ma Stevens, across the street in
the big white house, serves meals to tourists now
and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather than spend an unpleasant half hour
in the garage, the girls walked over to the rambling
white house. They were reassured to see
that the yard was well kept and that everything
appeared orderly and clean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a chance on the food,&rdquo; Penny decided.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry enough to eat a fried
board!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stevens, a motherly looking woman in
a blue checked gingham dress, opened the door.
She looked slightly troubled at their request for
food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s later than I usually serve,&rdquo; she explained.
Then noticing their disappointed faces, she
added hastily: &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re not too particular,
I can find you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;something&rdquo; consisted of a generous
platter of mountain trout, fresh from the stream
and fried to a golden brown, French fried potatoes,
a salad, and cherry pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, after such a meal, we may not be
able to get to Raven Ridge,&rdquo; Penny remarked,
finishing her second piece of pie. &ldquo;I never ate
so much in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say you were going to Raven
Ridge?&rdquo; Mrs. Stevens inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re waiting now to have a tire
patched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the second party through here today
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
that&rsquo;s heading for Raven Ridge,&rdquo; Mrs. Stevens
informed. &ldquo;A man stopped for lunch about an
hour ago. Only he thought it wasn&rsquo;t cooked
well enough for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have been particular,&rdquo; Penny commented.
&ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was tall and dark and he had a sharp way
of watching one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it could have been that man who
passed us on the road?&rdquo; Penny mused. &ldquo;Was
he driving a gray coup&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was convinced that the man Mrs.
Stevens described was the same person who had
declined to help her on the road. She wondered
what business took him to Raven Ridge. Could
she have been mistaken in believing him to be
the thief who had stolen the diamond ring?</p>
<p>Paying for the luncheon, the girls went back
to the garage. The tire was ready for them.
Soon they were on their way again.</p>
<p>They had driven for perhaps an hour when
Penny observed that the road seemed to be leading
them out of the mountains. She began to
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
wonder if they had taken a wrong turn. She
stopped at the next filling station to inquire.
To her dismay, she was told that she had traveled
nearly twenty miles out of her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought this didn&rsquo;t seem like the right
road,&rdquo; Penny declared ruefully to her companion.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll be lucky to get to Raven Ridge
by dinner time, to say nothing of returning to
Mt. Ashland tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put you to a great deal of trouble,&rdquo; Rosanna
said regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. This trip to Raven Ridge is an
adventure, and I like it. It will be more fun to
stay over night anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An occasional road marker reassured the girls
that at last they were on the right highway. The
mountain curves were sharp, and Penny did not
make as good time as she had anticipated. She
became a little alarmed to see that storm clouds
were rapidly gathering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we may have rain,&rdquo; Rosanna
commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal of it, I&rsquo;d judge. Those clouds
are black as ink.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>In less than half an hour the storm struck
them in full force. A great gust of wind dashed
huge drops of water against the windshield,
there was a vivid flash of lightning, then the rain
came down in steady sheets.</p>
<p>Even with the wiper going Penny could see
only a few feet ahead of the windshield. She
pulled up under a huge oak tree at the side of
the road. The girls waited a quarter of an hour
and still the rain fell in torrents. At length,
however, it slackened slightly, and not wishing
to lose any more time, Penny cautiously drove
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t last much longer,&rdquo; Rosanna said
optimistically.</p>
<p>Despite her hopeful words, the rain showed
no sign of stopping. Penny reconciled herself
to a slow pace for the remainder of the journey.
She was beginning to grow tired. Her back and
arms ached and it was a strain to keep such close
watch of the road.</p>
<p>With the sun hidden from view, night came
on early. Nervous at the thought of driving
over unfamiliar mountain roads after dark, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
girls did not stop for dinner. Nine o&rsquo;clock, in
a pouring rain, found them drawn up at a filling
station to inquire how much farther it was
to Raven Ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re practically there now,&rdquo; the attendant
informed. &ldquo;What place are you looking
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jacob Winters&rsquo; estate,&rdquo; Penny replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then keep on this road for about two miles
more. When you come to the top of the ridge,
take the gravel road to the left. It will lead you
to the house. There&rsquo;s no one there though, unless
maybe a caretaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Penny murmured, &ldquo;then perhaps you
can direct us to a place where we can spend the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearest is at the town of Andover, five
miles beyond the Winters&rsquo; place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls thanked the man for his assistance,
and once more followed the winding road up
the mountainside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go on to Andover or stop at
the Winters&rsquo; house?&rdquo; Penny asked her companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; Rosanna faltered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place surely must have a caretaker,
Rosanna. Let&rsquo;s take a chance and stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the top of the ridge they watched for the
gravel road and were elated to find it. The entrance
was barred by a white gate. Rosanna
stepped out in the rain to open it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may have been a foolish thing to do,&rdquo;
Penny admitted as they drove between tall rows
of whispering pines. &ldquo;We could have gone on
to Andover only I dreaded driving down the
mountainside with slippery roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna huddled closer to her friend. The
road was dark and the rustling of the wind in
the pine needles made her uneasy.</p>
<p>Soon they came within view of the house.
It was built of native stone, half hidden by the
luxuriant growth of shrubbery and trees which
surrounded it. No lights gleamed in the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one here,&rdquo; Rosanna declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s knock anyway. The caretaker may be
at the rear somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>They parked the car as close to the front door
as possible and made a dash for the porch.
Penny knocked several times on the massive
door but there was no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might try your key, Rosanna,&rdquo; she proposed.
&ldquo;If it fits I&rsquo;ll begin to think there&rsquo;s something
to that mysterious letter you received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna groped in her pocketbook for the
key. Impatient for action, Penny turned the
handle of the door. To her astonishment the
latch clicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the door is already unlocked, Rosanna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course we won&rsquo;t dare go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem right. The people may
not be at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone must be around or the door
wouldn&rsquo;t be unlocked. Besides, you have a key,
Rosanna. And according to the letter, this is
your inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny swung wide the door. She peered inside
but could see nothing. Her hand groped
for the electric switch. She found the button
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
by the door and pressed it. Instantly everything
was flooded with light.</p>
<p>The girls found themselves in a long, narrow
living room. The ceiling was beamed, the
furniture was rustic, and a great fireplace occupied
one end of the wall.</p>
<p>Penny crossed over to the hearth. There was
no fire but logs were in readiness to make one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel right about coming in here,&rdquo;
Rosanna said nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, if it&rsquo;s your property you&rsquo;re not
trespassing,&rdquo; Penny insisted. &ldquo;Besides, it looks
to me as if you were expected, for everything
seems in readiness for guests. I&rsquo;m going to
build a fire and see if I can&rsquo;t thaw out my chilled
bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Rosanna went to help her. Soon
they had a roaring fire in the hearth. As they
grew more comfortable they took more interest
in their surroundings. The room was plainly
but expensively furnished. Curious objects
from many lands occupied the tables and bric-a-brac
shelves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle must have lived an interesting
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
life,&rdquo; Penny commented, picking up a tiny ivory
box from a nearby stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother often told me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna&rsquo;s voice broke in the midst of the
sentence. Turning, Penny saw that her friend&rsquo;s
eyes were fastened upon the window. All color
had drained from Rosanna&rsquo;s face. Her eyes
were dilated with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Penny demanded.</p>
<p>Rosanna clutched her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw someone just then,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s face at the window!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />The Lost Key</h2>
<p>Penny turned quickly toward the window.
She saw nothing save the rain trickling
down the panes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have imagined it, Rosanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. I know I saw a face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna huddled close to Penny. She was
afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and look out,&rdquo; Penny proposed daringly.</p>
<p>Before Rosanna could stop her she moved to
the door and flung it open. A man in oilskins
confronted her. His face was half hidden
by the felt hat which he wore low over his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Penny asked nervously.</p>
<p>Without answering, the man stepped into the
room. Under the electric light he did not look
as terrifying as he had at first glance. Penny
saw when he swept off his dripping hat that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
was an elderly man although spry for his years.
She felt slightly reassured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to find out what you mean by entering
Mr. Winters&rsquo; house when he&rsquo;s away?&rdquo; the
man demanded curtly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand there staring
like a blind owl! Answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna had completely lost her power of
speech, so Penny tried to explain the situation.
She told how they had been caught by the storm
and mentioned Rosanna&rsquo;s key and letter which
gave her right to investigate the property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re old Jacob Winters&rsquo; niece?&rdquo; the man
questioned gruffly, peering intently at Rosanna.
&ldquo;At least that&rsquo;s what you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s my uncle, although I never
saw him,&rdquo; Rosanna defended. &ldquo;I can prove it
by my letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably wrote it yourself,&rdquo; the man
snapped. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s see it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; Penny interposed, feeling
that it was time the newcomer answered a few
questions of his own. &ldquo;Are you the caretaker
of this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and no. I&rsquo;m a neighbor of Mr. Winters
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and he asked me to keep an eye on his house
while he was away. I saw the light in the windows
and came to see what was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle is dead,&rdquo; Rosanna said quietly.
&ldquo;I have inherited the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacob Winters dead!&rdquo; the man exploded.
&ldquo;Why, I had a card from him last week. Mailed
from some place down in Africa. Let me see
that letter you claim to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna opened her pocketbook and searched
for it. A troubled look came over her face. She
was certain she had placed both the letter and
the key in the inside compartment. Now she
could find neither.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you haven&rsquo;t got it?&rdquo; the man said suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have it somewhere. I can&rsquo;t imagine
how I misplaced it. You remember the letter
don&rsquo;t you, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. You had it in your pocketbook
the last time I saw it. We&rsquo;re telling you the
absolute truth Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caleb Eckert,&rdquo; he supplied. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t
have a key how did you get into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the door was open&mdash;that is, it was unlocked,&rdquo;
Penny explained.</p>
<p>Caleb Eckert peered at her sharply as if trying
to make up his mind if she were speaking the
truth. Rosanna, who by this time had emptied
her purse out upon the table, was growing more
upset every minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s leave this house, Penny,&rdquo; she burst
out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost the letter and the key and so
we&rsquo;ve no right to be here at all. I didn&rsquo;t mean
to trespass. I wish we&rsquo;d never have come at all.
That letter has caused me so much grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna looked as if she might cry at any moment.
Caleb Eckert softened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to go out into
this storm. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned you may stay
here for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t care to intrude,&rdquo; Rosanna said
stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t safe to go down the mountain in this
rain,&rdquo; the man declared, adopting a more
friendly tone. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be offended by the
way I acted. My bark is worse than my bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t blame you for being suspicious,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Penny admitted. &ldquo;It may be that someone
played a joke on Rosanna in sending her the
letter and key. We were afraid of that from
the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb Eckert&rsquo;s eyes roved to the crackling fire,
then to the splattered windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; he proposed gruffly. &ldquo;You
girls stay here for the night. In the morning
we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t straighten things out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Mr. Winters is alive we have no right
to use this house,&rdquo; Rosanna protested weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re his niece, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Caleb demanded.
&ldquo;Jacob Winters wouldn&rsquo;t turn anyone
out in a storm, much less one of his own kin
folks. Have you had supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls admitted that they had not had any
food since lunch time. Caleb led them to the
kitchen, showing them where canned goods were
stored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re handy with a can opener there&rsquo;s
no need to starve,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>The girls thanked him for his trouble. Rosanna
timidly ventured a few questions concerning
her uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never see him?&rdquo; Caleb asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, once I wrote him a letter but he never
answered. I&rsquo;ve heard Uncle Jacob was very eccentric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some might call him that. He liked to live
alone and mind his own business which is more
than most folks do. He traveled a lot too. I
guess he must have visited every country in the
world.&rdquo; He added slyly: &ldquo;If Jacob <i>is</i> dead,
you&rsquo;ll come into possession of some valuable
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that nothing has happened to him,&rdquo;
Rosanna said sincerely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really care for
riches. All I want is a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacob Winters never liked girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Rosanna sighed. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s
why he never answered my letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You counted a lot on the inheritance, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Caleb questioned shrewdly.</p>
<p>Rosanna flushed but did not deny the accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that it might make my future more
secure,&rdquo; she acknowledged. &ldquo;Since Mother died
I&rsquo;ve battered around from one rooming house
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
to another. But even if I don&rsquo;t come into the
inheritance, I&rsquo;ll be glad that my uncle is still
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that he is,&rdquo; Caleb Eckert said
hastily. &ldquo;He was alive when he sent that postcard
from Africa. Since then we&rsquo;ve had no
word from him here at Raven Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the girls prepared food for themselves,
Caleb sat by the kitchen stove watching. He
showed them how to start a fire in the range
but would not partake of supper when it was
cooked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had mine four hours ago. I&rsquo;ll show you
where you can sleep and be getting on home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live near here?&rdquo; Penny asked
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not far. If the rain would let up you could
see my cabin through the dining room window.
It&rsquo;s perched on the edge of the cliff, overlooking
Lake Chippewa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna remarked that the scenery around
Raven Ridge must be beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis,&rdquo; Caleb agreed enthusiastically.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to walk down to the lake in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
morning. There are some mighty pretty trails
to follow too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we have time before we go, we&rsquo;ll surely
explore,&rdquo; Penny promised.</p>
<p>Caleb conducted them upstairs, opening the
door of one of the bedrooms. It was stuffy and
dusty but otherwise ready for occupancy.
Penny turned back the coverlet of the bed and
found that it was equipped with clean sheets
and blankets. The furniture was massive and
all hand carved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you can make out here for one night,&rdquo;
Caleb said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be very comfortable,&rdquo; Penny assured
him.</p>
<p>Returning to the lower floor, Caleb lighted
his lantern and prepared to leave. With his
hand on the door knob he turned to face the girls
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there was something I forgot to
mention. If you hear queer noises in the night
don&rsquo;t be upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer noises?&rdquo; Penny echoed.</p>
<p>Caleb nodded soberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Folks around here claim the house is haunted
but I never took stock in such stories myself. I
just thought I&rsquo;d warn you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before the girls could recover from their
astonishment, he firmly closed the door, disappearing
into the rain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />Midnight Visitors</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; Rosanna commented emphatically,
&ldquo;that I had never brought you to this
queer old house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed as she went over to the fireplace
and dropped on another stick of wood.
She stood watching the sparks fly up the
chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Caleb Eckert was only trying to be
funny when he warned us of ghosts,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;At any rate, I&rsquo;m too tired and sleepy to
care much whether the place is haunted or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good night to sleep,&rdquo; Rosanna admitted,
going to the window. &ldquo;I believe the
storm is getting worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rain pounded steadily upon the roof and the
wind was rising. It whistled weirdly around the
corners of the house. The tall maple trees
which shaded the front porch bent and twisted
and snapped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>For a time the girls sat before the fire. Presently
Penny suggested that they retire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I can sleep a wink tonight,&rdquo;
Rosanna protested. &ldquo;Even though Caleb Eckert
said it was all right for us to stay here, I don&rsquo;t
feel entirely easy about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; Penny protested as
they mounted the creaking stairs to their bedroom.
&ldquo;According to the letter, you&rsquo;ve inherited
the house. And you have a key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a key you mean. I can&rsquo;t understand
how or where I lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In thinking back over the activities of the
day, Rosanna could not recall taking either the
key or the letter from her purse. However,
several times for one purpose or another she had
opened her pocketbook, and it was quite likely
that the articles had fallen out unobserved. She
thought possibly she might find them on the floor
of Penny&rsquo;s car. She intended to search in the
morning.</p>
<p>The upstairs room was damp and chilly. The
girls hurriedly prepared to retire. Penny put
up the window, snapped out the light and made
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
a great running leap which landed her in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the wind howl,&rdquo; she murmured,
snuggling drowsily into her pillow. &ldquo;Just the
night for ghosts to be abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Rosanna shivered, gripping her
friend&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I can almost imagine that someone
is coming up the stairway now! I&rsquo;m afraid
of this lonely old house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let any mean old ghost get you,&rdquo;
Penny chuckled teasingly. &ldquo;I love stormy
nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna lay awake long after her companion
had fallen asleep. She listened restlessly to the
crash of the tree branches against the roof, the
creaking of old timbers and boards. But the
steady beat of rain on the windowpanes had a
soothing effect upon tense nerves. Presently
she dozed.</p>
<p>Suddenly she found herself wide awake. She
sat upright in bed, straining to hear. She was
convinced that some unusual sound had aroused
her.</p>
<p>Then she heard it again. A peculiar pounding
noise downstairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>She clutched Penny by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the latter muttered drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up! I think someone is trying to
break into the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the words penetrated Penny&rsquo;s consciousness,
she became instantly alert. She too sat up,
listening. Someone was pounding on the front
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; Rosanna whispered in
terror.</p>
<p>Penny sprang from bed and snapped on the
light. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to dress and go down. It may
be Caleb Eckert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a ghost,&rdquo; Rosanna chattered. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
going down, so am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the appearance of a light in the bedroom,
the clanging on the door increased in
violence. Penny, who was dressing as rapidly
as she could, began to grow irritated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they trying to break down the door?&rdquo;
she grumbled. &ldquo;I should think whoever it is
would know we&rsquo;re hurrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without delaying to lace up her shoes, she
ran down the stairs, Rosanna close at her elbow.
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Before snapping on the living room lights the
girls peered out the window.</p>
<p>Slightly reassured by the appearance of the
midnight visitors, they cautiously unbolted the
front door.</p>
<p>Mrs. Everett Leeds and her daughter Alicia,
swept into the room. Both were bedraggled and
obviously out of sorts.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds shook the rain from her cape,
flung her wet hat into the nearest chair, and then
coldly surveyed the two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, may I ask?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>were</i> sleeping,&rdquo; Penny smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, what are you doing in this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to belong to Rosanna,&rdquo; Penny said
evenly. &ldquo;She inherited it from her uncle, Jacob
Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; expression was difficult to interpret.
For an instant she looked stunned. But
she quickly recovered her poise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she said shortly. &ldquo;This house
belongs to me. Jacob Winters was my cousin.
He died recently, leaving me everything. I have
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
a letter and key to prove it. Naturally I couldn&rsquo;t
use my key to get into the house for you had it
bolted from the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds looked accusingly at the girls as
she offered the letter to Penny. A casual glance
assured the girls that it was identical with the
one Rosanna had received and lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to go into this tonight,&rdquo; Penny
protested. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s discuss it in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds agreed coldly.
&ldquo;Where are we to sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny informed her that there were several
empty bedrooms upstairs. She led the way to
the upper floor. Opening the door of one of
the rooms, she was surprised to see that it was
not as well furnished as the bedroom which she
and Rosanna shared. Mrs. Leeds uttered an
exclamation of disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t expect me to sleep here,
Miss Nichols. The room is dirty. Positively
filthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that long cobweb hanging from the
ceiling!&rdquo; Alicia added indignantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have
hysterics if I slept here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the adjoining room is better,&rdquo;
Penny commented.</p>
<p>An inspection revealed that if anything it was
even more neglected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll just have to make the best
of it for tonight,&rdquo; Penny declared, &ldquo;unless you
care to drive on to the next town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds decided instantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer to sit up all night, rather than brave
those horrible mountain roads again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We slipped into a ditch coming here,&rdquo; Alicia
informed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what made us so late. We&rsquo;ve
had a terrible time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a closet at the end of the hall, Penny and
Rosanna found blankets and linen. As they
made up the beds, neither Mrs. Leeds nor her
daughter offered to assist. It was after one
o&rsquo;clock when the girls went back to their own
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Leeds means to make trouble about the
inheritance,&rdquo; Penny remarked in an undertone
as they snapped out the light once more. &ldquo;I
wonder if by any chance she could have picked
up your letter and key?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I doubt it,&rdquo; Rosanna returned. &ldquo;I remember
when we were at Mt. Ashland she
dropped the hint that she was going to Raven
Ridge. At least, she acted strangely when we
mentioned the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did. I had forgotten for the moment.
Oh well, in the morning we&rsquo;ll learn
exactly what she intends to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny rolled over and soon was sleeping
soundly. Toward morning she awoke to hear a
clock somewhere in the house chiming four.
At first she thought nothing of it, then it occurred
to her that no one had wound any of the
timepieces the previous evening. While she
was musing over such an odd happening her
keen ears detected the sound of soft footsteps
in the long hall outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably Mrs. Leeds or her daughter,&rdquo;
she reasoned.</p>
<p>The sounds persisted. At length Penny
quietly arose and tiptoed to the door. She
looked out into the dark hall. No one was
within sight. Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; door was closed.</p>
<p>Penny went back to bed, taking care not to
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
awaken Rosanna. Scarcely had she pulled the
blankets up than the soft pad of footsteps could
be heard again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t that ghost Caleb warned us
about,&rdquo; she thought uneasily. &ldquo;Oh, bother! I
know there aren&rsquo;t any ghosts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny closed her eyes and tried to sleep but
found it quite impossible. Even after the noise
in the hall ceased she caught herself listening for
the footsteps. At a quarter to seven she dressed
and stole downstairs to see what she could find
for breakfast.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock when Rosanna came into the
kitchen, Penny had coffee, cereal and crisp bacon
ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The larder seems very well supplied,&rdquo; she
informed cheerfully. &ldquo;Someone left milk on
our doorstep too. I imagine it must have been
Caleb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry enough to eat anything,&rdquo; Rosanna
declared. &ldquo;Shall I call Mrs. Leeds and
Alicia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do, although I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;ll
take to my cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Rosanna went upstairs to rap on Mrs. Leeds&rsquo;
door. She returned a minute later, reporting
that neither of the guests would be down for
breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were quite put out at being disturbed
so early,&rdquo; she told Penny ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let them get their own breakfasts then.
Come on, we&rsquo;ll have ours anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had learned to cook very well under
the tutelage of Mrs. Gallup. She had done remarkably
well with the meager supplies at her
disposal and Rosanna declared that the breakfast
was excellent.</p>
<p>The girls had finished the dishes and were
stacking them away when Alicia came down
the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother and I will take our breakfast now,&rdquo;
she informed.</p>
<p>Rosanna started toward the kitchen, but
Penny neatly blocked the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said cheerfully, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve just
finished ours. You&rsquo;ll find supplies in the
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alicia started to reply but without waiting
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
to hear what she might have to say, Penny and
Rosanna went out the back door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While she cools off we may as well look over
the grounds,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;If Mrs. Leeds
and Alicia expect to get along with me, they&rsquo;ll
have to learn that this household is going to
operate on a cafeteria basis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the rear door a sandstone path led down
a steep incline to the brow of a high cliff. A
river wound its way directly below, emptying
into a crystal blue lake. Deep in the pine woods,
some distance from the path, a cabin could be
seen. The girls decided that it must belong
to Caleb Eckert.</p>
<p>While they were admiring the rugged scenery,
someone came up behind them. They wheeled
about to face Caleb himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you both look bright and gay this
morning,&rdquo; he greeted heartily. &ldquo;Sleep well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; Rosanna told him shyly. &ldquo;That
is, we did until the visitors arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visitors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna explained about Mrs. Leeds and
her daughter while Penny added omitted details.
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
For some reason they both were beginning
to feel that Caleb was their ally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this talk about letters and keys and inheritances
certainly has me puzzled,&rdquo; he proclaimed,
shaking his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe
that Jacob Winters is dead. I think I&rsquo;ll walk
back to the house with you and have a little talk
with Mrs. Leeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you leave milk at our doorstep this
morning?&rdquo; Penny questioned as they returned
together.</p>
<p>Caleb admitted that he had placed it there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been very kind,&rdquo; Rosanna said gratefully.
&ldquo;I want to thank you before we leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not aiming to leave today?&rdquo; Caleb
asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I imagine we will. I don&rsquo;t feel
right about staying here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb lowered his voice. &ldquo;Take my advice,
Miss Winters, and don&rsquo;t leave while that other
woman and her daughter are here. From what
you&rsquo;ve told me, I think they mean to grab the
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can I do?&rdquo; Rosanna asked helplessly.
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my letter and the key. I
haven&rsquo;t any proof that the property was left to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this Leeds woman hasn&rsquo;t any proof
that it was left to her either,&rdquo; Caleb said sagely.
&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ll find out what she has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, Mrs. Leeds, accosted in the living
room of the old house, had little comment to
make. She was out of sorts from lack of sleep
the previous night, and the breakfast which she
and Alicia had endeavored to cook had not been
a success. Nor was she impressed with Caleb
who wore high boots, an old pair of dirty
trousers and a crumpled felt hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should discuss my business
affairs with you,&rdquo; she said aloofly. &ldquo;I have inherited
this property from my cousin and I
mean to remain here in possession of it indefinitely
if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see the letter which you say you received?&rdquo;
Caleb inquired.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds hesitated, then reluctantly handed
it over. Caleb studied it briefly and returned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will require more than this as evidence
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of Mr. Winters&rsquo; death,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;For
all I know, you may have forged this letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preposterous!&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds snapped. &ldquo;I refuse
to discuss the matter with you further. I
shall send for my attorney and he will straighten
out everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without the will, he can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Caleb returned
grimly. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no telling what
became of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will?&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds caught him up. &ldquo;Are
you sure there was a will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winters told me once that he had made
one and hidden it somewhere in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then of course it can be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winters wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone prying
around in his private papers,&rdquo; Caleb insisted.
&ldquo;Until I have definite word that he is dead, I
can&rsquo;t let anyone hunt for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t call searching for the will exactly
prying!&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds retorted indignantly.
&ldquo;What right have you to say what is to be done
here? Are you the caretaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly, but Mr. Winters asked me
to look after things until he got back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will must be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb&rsquo;s face tightened. &ldquo;Mrs. Leeds,&rdquo; he
said severely, &ldquo;I repeat, things in this house must
not be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds drew herself up proudly. &ldquo;Unquestionably,
the will leaves everything to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; Caleb acknowledged, &ldquo;but
this girl here has a claim too.&rdquo; He indicated
Rosanna.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds froze her with a glance. Her eyes
snapped like brands of fire as she listened to
Rosanna&rsquo;s account of the letter and key. But
a look of relief, which was not lost upon either
of the girls, came over her face as she learned
that they had been misplaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story sounds ridiculous to me,&rdquo; Mrs.
Leeds declared coldly. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t produce
the letter or the key, what proof have you that
you actually are Jacob Winters&rsquo; niece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could get evidence within a few days,&rdquo;
Rosanna declared. &ldquo;The letter and key may
show up too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think perhaps you dropped them in the
car,&rdquo; Penny interrupted. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Leaving Mrs. Leeds and Caleb embroiled in
another argument, they went outside where the
automobile had been parked near the house.
A careful search of the flooring and pockets of
the car did not reveal the missing letter or key.
Rosanna was completely discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Mrs. Leeds could have picked
it up?&rdquo; she asked gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; Penny returned thoughtfully.
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing certain. She intends
to make trouble. You surely don&rsquo;t intend
to go away from here while she and her daughter
are camped in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send a wire to Dad that we&rsquo;re staying on a
day or two,&rdquo; Penny answered instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t that inconvenience both of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suspect Dad will be grateful for the
rest and as for myself, I&rsquo;d enjoy seeing this thing
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It required little urging to convince Rosanna
of the wisdom of remaining on the scene. She
had taken an immediate dislike to Mrs. Leeds
and her daughter, and agreed with Penny that
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
they were determined to claim more than a
rightful share of the inheritance.</p>
<p>Once the girls arrived at a decision they lost
no time in driving to the nearest town where
Penny dispatched a message to her father.
Noticing an inviting looking restaurant, they ate
lunch before motoring back to the Winters&rsquo;
mansion. It was nearly two o&rsquo;clock when they
reached the Ridge again.</p>
<p>An unfamiliar car stood on the driveway.
Penny was certain it did not belong to Mrs.
Leeds for her mud-splattered sedan was parked
some distance away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like more visitors,&rdquo; she commented
as they crossed the veranda together.</p>
<p>At the doorway both girls involuntarily
paused. Mrs. Leeds was engaged in conversation
with a stranger.</p>
<p>For an instant Penny and Rosanna stood and
stared. It was the same man who had refused
them help on the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />&ldquo;Ghost&rdquo; Music</h2>
<p>As Penny and Rosanna entered the living
room, the stranger turned to face them.
For a long moment Penny was convinced
that he was the shoplifter who had stolen
the diamond ring from the Belton City department
store. His build was the same and the
general lines of his face were similar. Then the
man spoke and she was not certain at all. The
tone of his voice was entirely different as was
his abrupt manner of speaking.</p>
<p>A trifle nervously, or so it seemed to Penny,
Caleb Eckert introduced the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Laponi,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He represents himself
as a nephew of Jacob Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only do I represent myself as such, but I
have proof that I am Uncle Jacob&rsquo;s nephew,&rdquo;
the stranger retorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find my credentials
in order. I&rsquo;ve come to take over the
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>The girls were not greatly surprised when he
took from his pocket a letter similar to the one
which Mrs. Leeds had produced. They were
more impressed with the other papers which he
offered for Caleb&rsquo;s inspection&mdash;a birth certificate,
a letter of identification from a well
known Chicago banker and various legal documents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if someone has played a
joke on all you folks,&rdquo; Caleb said slowly. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t know that Mr. Winters is even dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we do,&rdquo; Max Laponi insisted, producing
another letter. &ldquo;This came from my
attorney this morning. It definitely states that
Mr. Winters&mdash;Uncle Jacob&mdash;was buried at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb sank down in a chair. He scarcely
read the letter although his face had turned an
ashen hue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it even now,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;There must be some mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake,&rdquo; Max cut in sharply.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear enough that I am the heir too. By
the way, didn&rsquo;t the old man have a valuable collection
of ivories?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Caleb stiffened visibly. &ldquo;Ivories?&rdquo; he asked
blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, some pieces he collected years ago on
his tours. Read about it in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you read about it?&rdquo; Caleb echoed
significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Jacob told me about the collection
too. He always intended me to have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you should know where to find it,&rdquo;
Caleb retorted bluntly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he turned and walked to the door.
There he paused to fling over his shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wash my hands of the whole matter. You
folks will have to fight it out among you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds had managed to hold her tongue
very well, but the moment that the door closed
behind Caleb, she began an angry attack upon
Rosanna and the newcomer, accusing both of
being impostors. Unwilling to listen to such
an unreasonable tirade, Penny and Rosanna fled
out of doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a mad house!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed, taking
a deep breath. &ldquo;I have to keep pinching
myself to believe it&rsquo;s real!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a hopeless muddle,&rdquo; Rosanna
added. &ldquo;Everyone is so eager for the
property no one gives the slightest thought to
the tragedy which befell poor Mr. Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he isn&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; Penny suggested.</p>
<p>Rosanna stared. &ldquo;What makes you think
that? Didn&rsquo;t Mr. Laponi have proof of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed to have proof of everything,&rdquo;
Penny admitted with a rueful laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what makes me suspicious. There&rsquo;s something
strange about this entire affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced of one thing, Rosanna.
Either Mrs. Leeds or this man Laponi is an impostor.
At first I thought Laponi was the same
person who stole the ring. Now I can&rsquo;t be
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna did not believe that the two were
identical although she admitted there was a close
resemblance. However, she was quite willing
to agree that the man seemed like an impostor
despite his credentials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have picked up that letter and key
you lost,&rdquo; Penny went on, thinking aloud. &ldquo;And
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
there was something rather sinister in the way
he mentioned the collection of ivories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed that. Caleb seemed disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if he knows where
Mr. Winters kept the collection,&rdquo; Penny continued.
&ldquo;At any rate, he&rsquo;s wise to pretend
ignorance. With such a mad lot of people in
the house, anything might happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noticing a nearby path which led to a spring
house, the girls followed it, drinking of the cool
mountain water. They sat down on a bench
which afforded a view of the tall chalk-like cliffs.
After a time they felt soothed and tranquil again.
They presently walked back to the house.</p>
<p>Max Laponi was nowhere to be seen although
Alicia told them that he was busy moving his
things into one of the upstairs bedrooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s worried since he came,&rdquo; the girl
confided, growing more friendly. &ldquo;They had a
dreadful quarrel. Now she&rsquo;s hunting for the
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Caleb Eckert warned her not to do
that,&rdquo; Penny protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old meddler has nothing to do with
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
this place,&rdquo; Alicia declared with a toss of her
head. &ldquo;I hope he minds his own business and
stays away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls found Mrs. Leeds in the library.
She was going through the drawers of the desk
in systematic fashion, tossing papers carelessly
on the floor. One drawer was locked. She
shook it viciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not Jacob Winters&rsquo; will is locked up
in there,&rdquo; she said irritably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half a notion
to break into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Rosanna cried indignantly,
before she could check herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds demanded
tartly. &ldquo;Jacob Winters is dead isn&rsquo;t he? And
his will must be found. I suppose you&rsquo;re afraid
to have the document come to light for fear
you&rsquo;ll be cut off completely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna&rsquo;s cheeks flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of such a thing, Mrs. Leeds.
I think it&rsquo;s disgraceful the way everyone is acting
about the property!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Leeds could reply, she ran from
the room. Penny loyally followed, joining Rosanna
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
in the bedroom which they shared. She
found the orphan in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; Penny advised kindly. &ldquo;Mrs.
Leeds is so intent on getting the money that she
doesn&rsquo;t realize what she says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I ever came here. I want no part
in this disgraceful grab for Uncle Jacob&rsquo;s
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how you feel,&rdquo; Penny agreed, &ldquo;but
let&rsquo;s stay a day or two. I&rsquo;m curious to learn just
what is going on here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In truth, she was completely baffled. It was
difficult for her to make up her mind whether
or not the entire arrangement was a hoax.
Somehow she had distrusted Laponi&rsquo;s credentials.
She distrusted him too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he could be a nephew of Jacob
Winters,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I wish there was some
way to trace down his past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was clear to Penny that Rosanna would
never defend her claim to the inheritance. Unless
she personally took a hand in the affair, Mrs.
Leeds and Max Laponi would ignore the orphan
completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let them make the first move,&rdquo; she decided
shrewdly. &ldquo;For the time being I&rsquo;ll play
a waiting game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the greater part of the afternoon, Penny
and Rosanna remained in their own room. Toward
nightfall they walked about the grounds
and later motored to a nearby inn for dinner.
At nine o&rsquo;clock when they returned to the big
empty house, the downstairs was dark. They
judged that Mrs. Leeds and Max Laponi had
already gone to their rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well turn in too,&rdquo; Penny suggested.
&ldquo;The mountain air makes one drowsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls were soon sound asleep. However,
sometime later Penny was awakened by the
sound of footsteps in the hall. She thought little
of it, and rolling over, tried to go to sleep again.
Suddenly she heard soft music from above.</p>
<p>She sat up in bed, listening. A strain of a
famous opera resounded through the room, rising
in volume, then falling away. Penny knew
that she was not imagining it. She nudged her
companion who quickly awakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear the same thing I do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Rosanna clutched the sheets more tightly
about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost music,&rdquo; she whispered in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like pipe organ music coming from
a long distance away,&rdquo; Penny whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to find out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Rosanna could prevent it, she stole
from bed and swiftly tiptoed to the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />The Ivory Collection</h2>
<p>Penny quietly opened the bedroom door,
peering out into the long dark hall. She
could hear the music distinctly. It seemed
to be coming from almost directly overhead.</p>
<p>By this time, Rosanna, overcoming her fear,
crept beside her friend. They huddled together,
listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an organ. I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; Penny whispered.
&ldquo;But where can it be hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of this place,&rdquo; Rosanna chattered.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s lock the bedroom door and leave in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny made no response. For that matter
she did not even hear for she was intent upon
trying to localize the sound of the music. Never
inclined to be superstitious, she had no thought
that the old house was haunted. She felt certain
that the ghost-like music was man made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house must have a third floor or an
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
attic,&rdquo; she declared softly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can
find our way up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny started off down the hall. Rosanna
hesitated, and then, unable to watch her friend
walk into danger alone, hurriedly followed.
Halfway down the hall she reached for the electric
switch but Penny caught her hand before
she could turn on the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! It would give warning that we&rsquo;re
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Groping about in the dark the girls went
past Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; bedroom and the one occupied
by the stranger. Penny noted that the doors of
both were tightly closed. At the end of the hall
she found still another door. Gently she turned
the handle and opened it. A steep flight of
stairs led upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, let&rsquo;s not go up,&rdquo; Rosanna
pleaded, trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay here,&rdquo; Penny said in a whisper. &ldquo;If
anything goes wrong, let out a cry for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mysterious music had ceased for the moment.
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Penny waited until it began again, and
then, following the sound, crept noiselessly up
the stairs leaving Rosanna on guard below.</p>
<p>At the top of the last step Penny paused to
listen again. Actually, she was not as courageous
as she had pretended. She could hear her own
heart pounding.</p>
<p>It was so dark on the third floor that at first
she could distinguish nothing. The music had
increased in volume and Penny was more sure
than ever that it came from a hidden pipe
organ.</p>
<p>As her eyes focused better she found herself
standing upon a small landing from which
branched two closed doors. After a slight hesitation
she tiptoed to the nearest one and opened
it a tiny crack.</p>
<p>Although no sound had betrayed her, the
music from within ended with a discordant
crash. Startled, Penny allowed the door to swing
wide. She started forward, and suddenly
tripped. Until that moment her nerve had held
steady. But as she stumbled and fell she uttered
a shrill cry of terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Rosanna, fearing the worst, came running up
the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny! Penny! Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reassured by her friend&rsquo;s voice, Penny
scrambled to her feet and met Rosanna at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; she said shakily. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve
done enough investigating for one night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What frightened you so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lost no time in returning to the lower
floor. Down the hall, Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; door had
opened. A light flashed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is going on here?&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds demanded,
emerging into the hallway. &ldquo;Such a
house I never saw! First it&rsquo;s music&mdash;then a
scream! It&rsquo;s enough to send one into hysterics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Rosanna could not refrain from
smiling, for Mrs. Leeds looked ridiculous in her
curlers which were sticking out from her head
at all angles. Before they could answer, Alicia
joined her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you could go to your room
and let folks sleep!&rdquo; she said irritably. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
been running up and down the hall all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong there,&rdquo; Penny returned.
&ldquo;This is the first time Rosanna or I have stirred
from our room. We got up to investigate the
mysterious music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you heard it too?&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds breathed
in awe. &ldquo;I thought perhaps I had imagined that
part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you heard music all right,&rdquo; Penny told
her grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t&mdash;you don&rsquo;t think the house is
haunted?&rdquo; Alicia stammered nervously. &ldquo;That
old man&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name&mdash;was trying to tell us
about someone having died in a room on the
upper floor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the music seemed to come from the
third floor,&rdquo; Penny informed, relishing the effect
which her words produced. &ldquo;As for the scream,
I can account for that. I tripped and fell. Now
I think we may as well all go back to bed.
There&rsquo;s been so much commotion that I rather
judge our &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; has been frightened away for
the time being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep a wink after all this has happened,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Mrs. Leeds declared. &ldquo;I shall sit up
until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; Penny said indifferently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she walked down the hall to her own room
she glanced rather sharply at the door of Max
Laponi&rsquo;s room. It was still tightly closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend appears to be a sound sleeper,&rdquo;
she remarked to Rosanna.</p>
<p>In the privacy of their bedroom, Rosanna demanded
to know exactly what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t see much,&rdquo; Penny admitted.
&ldquo;But I did learn one interesting thing. There&rsquo;s
a pipe organ installed in this house. I might
have discovered who was playing it too only I
tripped over a rope which had been strung up
in front of the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Placed there deliberately, you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. It startled me so that I let out
that wild yell. I don&rsquo;t care to do any more investigating
tonight, but in the morning I mean
to have a good look at that room upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have more nerve than I,&rdquo; Rosanna declared
admiringly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Penny carefully locked the outside door before
turning out the light. It was twenty
minutes after twelve by her wrist watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t call it nerve exactly,&rdquo; she replied
thoughtfully, climbing into bed. &ldquo;The truth
is, I&rsquo;m a little afraid, Rosanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you go up there again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that. It isn&rsquo;t the music
that has me frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what else is there to be afraid of?&rdquo; Rosanna
persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a feeling, I guess,&rdquo; Penny admitted.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;only it seems to me that some
sinister plot is brewing in this old house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the same sensation,&rdquo; Rosanna confessed.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed softly and settled herself more
comfortably in the pillows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the daughter of
a detective you know! This is our own special
mystery case, and unless that ghost gets me first,
I intend to get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that threat, Penny rolled over and lost
herself in sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>The warm sun was streaming in at the windows
when the girls aroused themselves. They
dressed and went downstairs, finding the house
quite deserted. Apparently Mrs. Leeds, her
daughter and Max Laponi had gone to the village
for breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they had vanished for good but there&rsquo;s
no use hoping that,&rdquo; Penny commented. &ldquo;I
doubt if even a ghost could keep Mrs. Leeds
from remaining until the estate is settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls cooked their own breakfast, utilizing
supplies which they had purchased at the
nearby town. As they washed the dishes and
stacked them away, Rosanna mentioned again
that she did not feel comfortable about making
such free use of her unknown uncle&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t just the thing to do,&rdquo; Penny
acknowledged, &ldquo;but the situation isn&rsquo;t a normal
one either. If Mr. Eckert says it is all right
for us to stay on, I don&rsquo;t think we should
worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it do us any good to remain?&rdquo; Rosanna
pondered in a troubled tone. &ldquo;If Mr. Eckert
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
can&rsquo;t tell us what became of my uncle, who
could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the point, Rosanna. I believe he
knows more than he lets on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s gaze wandered to the tiny log cabin
set back in the pine woods. Wisps of thin smoke
curled from the chimney. That meant that
Caleb must be at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk down there and talk with him,&rdquo;
she proposed impulsively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time he answers
a few of our questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb did not come to the door to answer their
timid knock. Instead he called out a hearty,
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; which they instantly obeyed.</p>
<p>Caleb was the picture of comfort, sitting
propped back in his chair by the window, puffing
at an old pipe. He arose reluctantly and dusted
off two camp stools for the visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought perhaps you might furnish us
with a little information,&rdquo; Penny began
pleasantly.</p>
<p>Her eyes roved swiftly about the room. She
noticed the open bookcase with four rows of
well-thumbed volumes. The titles were impressive.
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Caleb Eckert, despite his rough appearance,
seemingly had a liking for intellectual
books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it you want to know?&rdquo; Caleb
demanded, not unkindly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you before
that I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with this muddle
over Mr. Winters&rsquo; property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given up all hope of inheriting any of
the estate,&rdquo; Rosanna said. &ldquo;But I should
like to hear about my uncle. What was he
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some folks said he was the queerest man on
Snow Mountain. I liked him because he attended
to his own business. He was considered
a remarkable sportsman by some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s eyes traveled to a huge bear skin
which hung on the cabin wall. Caleb followed
her gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winters gave me that skin last year when
he came back from his trip north. A mighty
nice specimen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have a picture of Mr. Winters?&rdquo;
Penny asked, abruptly changing the subject.</p>
<p>Caleb shook his head. He began to talk about
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the bear skin again. Rosanna listened eagerly,
but Penny sensed that the old man was trying
to monopolize the conversation and thus keep
her from asking questions which he did not care
to answer.</p>
<p>When she succeeded in breaking in it was to
bring up the subject of Mr. Winters&rsquo; ivory collection.
Caleb seemed reluctant to offer definite
information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know is that Mr. Winters was supposed
to have one,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Folks said it was
worth a fortune and that he had spent years
gathering it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the collection?&rdquo; Penny inquired
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; Caleb retorted crossly.
&ldquo;Seems to me you girls ask a lot of silly questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean to be inquisitive,&rdquo; Penny
apologized. &ldquo;Only it struck me that Max
Laponi has an unusual interest in that collection
of ivory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb eyed her strangely. &ldquo;So you noticed it
too?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Penny nodded. &ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t say it,
but I don&rsquo;t trust that man, Mr. Eckert. If Mr.
Winters&rsquo; collection of ivory is still in the house,
don&rsquo;t you think it should be removed to a safer
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to do,&rdquo; Caleb muttered,
looking out the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do know where the ivory collection
is,&rdquo; Penny tripped him.</p>
<p>Caleb glared at her. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so, did I?
Why should Mr. Winters tell me where he kept
his valuables? Bosh! I tell you I won&rsquo;t be
mixed up in the muddle. Now go away and
let me sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb stretched himself out on the couch and
closed his eyes. Thus dismissed, the girls hastily
departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a cross old man!&rdquo; Rosanna exclaimed
when they were out of earshot. &ldquo;But even
though he is irritable, I rather like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Penny admitted with a laugh.
&ldquo;You know, I think our questions about the
ivory collection disturbed him more than he
cared to show.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He did seem reluctant to tell us anything
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll nail him down yet,&rdquo; Penny declared
grimly as they walked slowly toward the house
on the cliff. &ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m sadly mistaken, that
ivory collection is hidden somewhere on the
premises and he&rsquo;s scared silly for fear someone
will find it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />A Scrap of Paper</h2>
<p>Penny and Rosanna entered the house by
the side door. Hearing a murmur of
voices from the direction of the library,
they involuntarily paused to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we go into this thing as partners we&rsquo;re
both bound to profit,&rdquo; they heard a man say
in an insistent tone. &ldquo;Think it over and I know
you&rsquo;ll see how easily it can be accomplished.
Those two girls are nit-wits. They&rsquo;ll make no
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Rosanna exchanged a startled
glance. They recognized Max Laponi&rsquo;s voice.
So he was plotting against them! Undoubtedly,
planning to secure complete control of the Winters&rsquo;
estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out with whom he is talking,&rdquo;
Penny whispered.</p>
<p>Before Rosanna could protest, she walked to
the library door and opened it. Mrs. Leeds and
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Max Laponi were sitting at the desk, examining
some document which was spread out before
them. As Penny came in, Laponi whisked it
into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Penny said casually.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t at all, my dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds said
more graciously than was her custom. &ldquo;Mr.
Laponi was just showing me a letter from his
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, from my sister,&rdquo; Laponi echoed with a
slight smirk. &ldquo;She lives in Naples and writes
such interesting letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny found it difficult to refrain from smiling.
She pretended to search in the bookcase
for a volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought possibly you had discovered the
will,&rdquo; she remarked mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will! Oh, no!&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds assured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a good joke,&rdquo; Laponi echoed. &ldquo;Ha!
Ha! Even a ferret couldn&rsquo;t find old Jacob Winters&rsquo;
will in this house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was aware that both Mrs. Leeds and
Max Laponi were watching her shrewdly, trying
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
to make up their minds if she had overheard
anything. She dared say no more lest she
betray herself. Picking up a book she quietly
withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I thought,&rdquo; she told Rosanna when
they were together in their bedroom. &ldquo;Laponi
is trying to get Mrs. Leeds involved in some
scheme to steal the property. Unless we watch
out, Rosanna, they&rsquo;ll get everything away from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care,&rdquo; Rosanna returned in
disgust. &ldquo;I never saw such disgraceful actions
in all my life. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I&rsquo;d
rather leave this place tomorrow and let the
lawyers settle everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be nothing left to settle when
Mrs. Leeds and Laponi get through. It&rsquo;s pretty
evident that one or the other is an impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t prove that, Penny. If only I
hadn&rsquo;t lost my key and the credentials!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only starting to work on this case,&rdquo;
Penny said cheerfully. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep our eyes
and ears open. We may discover something of
value.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Since their arrival at the old house, the girls
had awaited an opportunity to inspect the third
floor, hoping to discover the cause of the mysterious
music which had disturbed the household.
Penny suggested that while Mrs. Leeds
and Laponi were occupied in the library they
might make their tour of investigation. Rosanna
agreed but without enthusiasm. She was
not as venturesome as her companion.</p>
<p>Penny led the way to the third floor landing.
The hall was dark and dusty; cobwebs hung
from the corners of the ceiling.</p>
<p>Penny cast an appraising glance about her.
The doors leading from the hall were all closed.
She was certain that upon her previous visit
one had been slightly ajar.</p>
<p>She reached for the knob and turned it. The
door did not give. It was locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; Penny murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure this door was unlocked before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was the other one,&rdquo; Rosanna suggested.</p>
<p>They moved on down the hall to try the
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
second door. It too was securely fastened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I distinctly recall opening that other door,&rdquo;
Penny maintained. &ldquo;I started to go in and
tripped over something. I suspect it was a rope
stretched just inside the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we can&rsquo;t get in I guess we can&rsquo;t learn
anything,&rdquo; Rosanna said, somewhat in relief.</p>
<p>Penny made no response. She bent down to
peer through the keyhole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; Rosanna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a big empty room. But there is something
up against the far wall! Rosanna, it&rsquo;s a
pipe organ!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a minute she stepped away that her
friend might see for herself. Rosanna agreed
that the shadowy outline was an organ and a
magnificent one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The music came from this room all right,&rdquo;
Penny said excitedly. &ldquo;I wish we could get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After trying the door again, the girls returned
to the second floor. As Penny closed the stairway
door she noticed that it had a key. Upon
impulse she turned it in the lock and pocketed
the key with a smile of satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That should put a stop to the music for a
few nights,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show that
ghost I can lock a few doors myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they reached their own bedroom, Rosanna
said that she believed she would lie down for a
half hour. The events of the past few days had
worn her down, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; Penny urged: &ldquo;A sleep will refresh
you. I think I&rsquo;ll go downstairs and see if I can
discover what plot is brewing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She descended the spiral stairway and paused
at the library. It was empty. The house was
strangely silent. Penny crossed the hall to the
living room. Heavy draperies screened the
arched doorway. As Penny pulled them aside
to enter, she saw Mrs. Leeds standing at the
fireplace, her back to the door. Something
about her manner aroused Penny&rsquo;s suspicions.
She waited and watched.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds had built up a roaring fire on the
hearth. She held a paper in her hand. Deliberately,
she tore it into a dozen pieces and
dropped them into the flames.</p>
<p>Penny hastily entered the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Mrs. Leeds wheeled, her cheeks flushing.
&ldquo;How you startled me, Miss Nichols! You
surely have a way of coming in quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Penny said, walking over to the
hearth. &ldquo;How nice to have a fire, although it
is a little warm today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room seemed damp,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds said
nervously. &ldquo;I was cold. I think I&rsquo;ll go to my
room and get a sweater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The instant Mrs. Leeds had disappeared,
Penny snatched a charred piece of paper from
the hearth. It was the only scrap which had not
been completely consumed by the flames.</p>
<p>Only a few scattered lines with many words
missing were visible. The others were blackened
or torn away.</p>
<p>Penny distinguished a part of the writing:
&ldquo;Last will and testam&mdash; &mdash;do bequeath to my
niece, Ro&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be a portion of Jacob Winters&rsquo;
will!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Mrs. Leeds probably
found it somewhere in the house and decided to
destroy it because she or her daughter weren&rsquo;t
mentioned!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>She stared at the word which began Ro&mdash;&mdash;.
The remaining letters had been torn away. Had
Mr. Winters written Rosanna&rsquo;s name? If only
she had entered the living room a minute earlier
she might have prevented the document from
being destroyed!</p>
<p>In reviewing Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; actions during the
past two days, Penny could not doubt that the
woman had actually found the missing will.
Since her arrival at Raven Ridge she had spent
most of her time poking about into odd corners
of the house. The locked drawer of the desk
had annoyed her exceedingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just take a look and see if it&rsquo;s still locked,&rdquo;
Penny thought.</p>
<p>She opened the desk and tried the drawer.
It readily opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty,&rdquo; Penny commented grimly. &ldquo;Just
as I suspected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She examined the lock. It was evident at a
glance that it had been broken by a sharp instrument
and not unlocked with a key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will was hidden in this drawer,&rdquo; she
mused. &ldquo;I feel confident of it. And it must
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
have been drawn up in Rosanna&rsquo;s favor or Mrs.
Leeds never would have destroyed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny closed the desk and carefully placed
the charred bit of paper in her dress pocket.
She was deeply disturbed over the discovery,
realizing that Mrs. Leeds, by destroying the document,
had gained a great advantage. However,
she had no intention of abandoning the fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep this strictly to myself,&rdquo; she decided.
&ldquo;For the present I&rsquo;ll not even tell Rosanna. It
would only disappoint her to learn that the will
has been burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; arrival at Raven Ridge,
Penny had done everything in her power to
avoid a break with the arrogant society woman.
She had ignored snubs and many unkind remarks.
Now she felt that if Rosanna&rsquo;s interests
were to be safeguarded, she no longer could afford
to play a waiting game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Leeds and Max Laponi have shown
their hand,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;They mean to gain
their ends by any possible means. But since
they&rsquo;re stooping to underhanded tricks, I may
have a few little schemes of my own!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Penny was unusually silent that evening.
Rosanna noticed it at once but thinking that her
friend was absorbed in her own thoughts, refrained
from questioning her.</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock the girls motored to Andover
for dinner. To their chagrin, Mrs. Leeds and
her daughter Alicia chanced to select the same
cafe. All during the meal, Penny noticed the
woman&rsquo;s eyes upon her. As she and Rosanna
arose to leave, Mrs. Leeds hastily followed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Winters, may I speak with you a moment?&rdquo;
she began coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, of course,&rdquo; Rosanna responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna hesitated and glanced at Penny.
The latter started to move away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Rosanna said quickly. &ldquo;I
am sure that anything Mrs. Leeds may wish to
say to me can be said in front of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds returned icily.
&ldquo;Evidence has reached me today which proves
conclusively that I am Jacob Winters&rsquo; sole heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna took the blow without the quiver
of an eyelash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What evidence, may I ask, Mrs. Leeds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to go into that, Miss
Winters. Certainly not in the presence of
strangers or on the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny isn&rsquo;t exactly a stranger,&rdquo; Rosanna
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the first I have been very tolerant, I
think,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds went on, ignoring the orphan&rsquo;s
remark. &ldquo;By your own admission you
have no credentials&mdash;we have only your word
that you are even related to Jacob Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a letter and key&mdash;the same as you,&rdquo;
Rosanna faltered. &ldquo;Either I lost them or they
were stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Rosanna happens to be a niece of Mr.
Winters,&rdquo; Penny added significantly. &ldquo;I believe
you are only a cousin, Mrs. Leeds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman eyed her furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what is it that you want me to do?&rdquo;
Rosanna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you both should leave immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And allow you to have everything your
way,&rdquo; Penny interposed sweetly. &ldquo;Now
wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice&mdash;for you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>She took Rosanna by the arm and urged her
toward the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t allow Miss Nichols to poison your
mind!&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds pleaded, following Rosanna
to the curbing. &ldquo;Unless you leave immediately
you will receive no part of the fortune. If you
go without making any further trouble, I might
agree to some small settlement. After all, I
mean to be generous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for telling us,&rdquo; Penny smiled.</p>
<p>She closed the car door and they drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t have been so short
with her,&rdquo; Rosanna said uneasily as they returned
to the house on Snow Mountain. &ldquo;If
it&rsquo;s true that the property has been left to her,
then she was being generous to offer to give me
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, she&rsquo;d forget her promise soon
enough if she succeeded in getting you away
from here, Rosanna. I detest that woman. She
thinks she is so subtle and she&rsquo;s as transparent as
glass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what evidence she referred to?&rdquo;
Rosanna mused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Penny started to speak, then changed her
mind. Although Mrs. Leeds had no suspicion
that she guessed the truth, she was well aware
of the nature of the new evidence. However,
she refrained from mentioning the burned will,
realizing that Rosanna, in her present depressed
state of mind, would be greatly disturbed by
the information. If the orphan believed that
she no longer had a definite claim to the fortune,
she would insist upon leaving Raven Ridge
without further delay.</p>
<p>Penny did not intend to quit the scene until
she had answered several questions to her satisfaction.</p>
<p>The entire case seemed a trifle fantastic as
she reviewed it. First, Rosanna had received
the strange letter signed by a fictitious name.
Then, although the orphan had lost the key,
they had found the door of the Winters&rsquo; mansion
unlocked. Close upon the heels of their
arrival, Mrs. Leeds, her daughter, and Max
Laponi appeared. Since then, the house had
been disturbed by haunting organ music and
one baffling event had crowded upon another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very bewildering,&rdquo; Penny reflected.
&ldquo;But I believe that everything can be fitted together
if only I am able to learn the identity
of the mysterious ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night closed in dark and windy. Penny
and Rosanna sat by the fire, trying to read.
They were relieved when Mrs. Leeds and her
daughter retired to their rooms shortly after
eight o&rsquo;clock for it gave them an opportunity
to talk. At ten o&rsquo;clock the girls went to their
own room. Max Laponi had not yet returned
from Andover where he took his meals.</p>
<p>Penny was tired and fell asleep almost as
soon as her head touched the pillow. Hours
later she was awakened by Rosanna who was
sitting upright in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Penny mumbled drowsily.</p>
<p>Then she knew. The house reverberated
with the soft chords of a pipe organ.</p>
<p>Without switching on the electric lights,
Penny drew on her dressing gown. She started
toward the door, then returned to grope in the
drawer of the dresser where she found the key
which locked the door leading to the attic floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Rosanna asked
anxiously, drawing the bedclothes closer about
her.</p>
<p>Penny already had gone. Stealing quietly
down the dark hall she reached the end of it
and stood listening. The door leading to the
third floor was closed. She could hear the music
more distinctly than before and knew for a certainty
that it came from above.</p>
<p>She gently tried the door. It was still locked.</p>
<p>Penny was momentarily baffled. She had
half expected to find the door unlocked. She
had been so confident that by taking the key
she could put a stop to the ghost music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the organist reach the third floor
if he didn&rsquo;t pass through this door?&rdquo; she debated.
&ldquo;That ghost must be quite a clever fellow
if he can enter without keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire house had been carefully locked
up for the night. Penny and Rosanna had attended
to it the last thing before retiring, knowing
that Max Laponi could come in later by
using his own pass key. They had secured every
door and window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t learn anything by standing
here,&rdquo; Penny thought uncomfortably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have to go up there.&rdquo; Her usual courage was
at low ebb. She dreaded the ordeal.</p>
<p>However, before she could open the stairway
door, a shrill scream echoed down the hall.</p>
<p>Terrified, Penny crouched back against the
wall and waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />The Wall Safe</h2>
<p>Recovering from her fright, Penny
reached up and snapped on the light.
She heard a door open down the hall.
Mrs. Leeds, a dressing gown clutched about her
unshapely figure, stumbled toward the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in my room! It struck
my face while I was sleeping! Oh, oh, such a
horrible house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Control yourself,&rdquo; Penny advised, taking
her by the arm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds jerked away, assuming an attitude
of tense listening. For the first time she had
paid heed to the organ music from above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo; she whispered in awe.
&ldquo;This house is haunted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna came down the hall, joining the
two at Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; door. Alicia huddled nearby,
too frightened to speak a word.</p>
<p>Penny opened the door and groped for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
electric switch. As the room was flooded with
light, she looked quickly about. Everything
was in disorder but that was because Mrs. Leeds
had done no straightening or cleaning since her
arrival.</p>
<p>Suddenly Penny began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray what do you find that is so humorous?&rdquo;
Mrs. Leeds demanded indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bats!&rdquo; Penny answered, laughing again.</p>
<p>There were four of them blinded by the light,
cowering in the corners of the room. Penny
opened a window and with Rosanna&rsquo;s help
drove them out into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have come in through an open
window,&rdquo; she said to Mrs. Leeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a window open,&rdquo; the woman
retorted. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to sleep in this room
again. Tomorrow I shall move into another.
Come Alicia, we&rsquo;ll sit up until morning in the
living room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to her own room, Penny listened
for the organ music. It had ceased as mysteriously
as it had begun. She glanced curiously
toward the room occupied by Max Laponi.
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
The door was closed. He alone of the entire
household seemed undisturbed by the strange
things which went on about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know if he really is in his room,&rdquo;
Penny thought.</p>
<p>She hesitated by the door but did not have
the courage to try the knob. After a moment
she followed Rosanna to their bedroom at the
other end of the hall.</p>
<p>Morning found Mrs. Leeds even more upset
than upon the previous night. Her eyes were
bloodshot, her face sallow, her clothes unpressed.
She quarreled with her daughter and
ignored Penny and Rosanna. However, when
Max Laponi came down the stairs looking as
dapper as ever, her attitude instantly changed.
She spoke to him in a softer tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were beginning to wonder if the ghost
made off with you last night,&rdquo; she said archly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say you didn&rsquo;t hear the music?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a sound,&rdquo; Laponi told her. &ldquo;I am a
very hard sleeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed disinclined to listen to Mrs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Leeds&rsquo; account of all that had transpired, and
very shortly drove away in his automobile, ostensibly
to have breakfast in a nearby town.</p>
<p>After straightening their room and making
the bed, Rosanna and Penny went for a short
walk. They sat down by the cliff where they
could see the river below, discussing the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s doing a particle of good
to stay here,&rdquo; Rosanna insisted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel
right about letting you waste so much time and
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna was thinking of the expensive meals
which they bought at Andover. Because her
own supply of cash had run so low, Penny paid
for everything. Rosanna meant to settle the
debt and it steadily grew larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Penny advised kindly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying on here largely because I&rsquo;ve determined
to discover the identity of our ghost.
Then, too, I can&rsquo;t bear to see Mrs. Leeds gain
what doesn&rsquo;t belong to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to stay if I thought it would do
the slightest good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will Rosanna. I have a scheme
which I intend to try. It will take a few days
before we can work things out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny then explained a part of what was in
her mind. She was not certain as to all the details
of her plan, but little by little it was taking
shape.</p>
<p>After a time the girls walked down to Caleb
Eckert&rsquo;s cabin. He was not at home. They
sauntered leisurely back to the house on the
cliff.</p>
<p>Neither Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; car nor the one belonging
to Max Laponi was on the driveway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re the only ones here this morning,&rdquo;
Penny commented.</p>
<p>They entered by the front door. From the
direction of the living room they heard a muffled
exclamation of impatience. Signaling for
silence, Penny tiptoed toward the velvet curtains
which hid the living room from view. She
parted them.</p>
<p>Caleb Eckert was working at the dials of a
wall safe which had been concealed in a secret
panel behind a large oil painting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Although the girls had made no sound, Caleb
sensed their presence. He turned and faced
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Eckert, doesn&rsquo;t this call for some
explanation?&rdquo; Penny asked in bewilderment.
&ldquo;Surely you have no right to tamper with Mr.
Winters&rsquo; safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man plainly was embarrassed. He
moistened his lips, looked away, then said
gruffly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to steal. I came because
I wanted to protect Mr. Winters&rsquo; valuables.
There&rsquo;s folks in this house that I don&rsquo;t trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how does it happen you know the combination
of the safe?&rdquo; Rosanna inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winters gave it to me before he left.
You see, he was my best friend. Jacob trusted
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have,&rdquo; cut in a sneering voice from
directly behind.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to see Max Laponi standing
in the doorway. His sharp little eyes moved
swiftly about the room taking in everything.
They came to rest upon the wall safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Caleb spun the dials. He hastily pressed a
concealed button and the picture swung back
into place, hiding the safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neat little device,&rdquo; Laponi commented
dryly. His eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Trying to steal
the Winters&rsquo; booty, were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Caleb retorted angrily.</p>
<p>Laponi caught him roughly by the shoulder,
forcing him back against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know a lot more than you let on,&rdquo; he
accused. &ldquo;Tell me, is that where old Winters
hid his ivory collection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you nothing,&rdquo; Caleb snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Laponi, you&rsquo;re hurting him!&rdquo; Rosanna
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we should call the police if there&rsquo;s
to be trouble,&rdquo; Penny added cunningly.</p>
<p>At the mention of police, Laponi instantly
released his grip on Caleb. He laughed
harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let it go this time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
warning you, Eckert, stay away from this house
and this safe if you know what&rsquo;s good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You might take that advice to yourself, too,&rdquo;
the old man retorted, edging toward the door.</p>
<p>From the window the girls watched him hurry
down the path to his own cabin. His departure
was almost flight. Obviously, Caleb was afraid.</p>
<p>Penny did not know what to believe. An
hour before she would have taken oath that he
was strictly honest, devoted to the interests
of Jacob Winters. Now she could not be
sure.</p>
<p>Max Laponi lingered in the living room.
Suspecting that he intended to investigate the
wall safe the instant he was alone, Penny and
Rosanna settled themselves for a long stay.
They pretended to read.</p>
<p>After an hour, Laponi grew tired of the game,
and went off, grumbling to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We outlasted him that time,&rdquo; Penny
chuckled. &ldquo;However, we&rsquo;ll have to be on the
lookout or he&rsquo;ll sneak back sometime when
we&rsquo;re gone. I wonder if Mr. Winters did leave
his ivory collection in the safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laponi seems to think so,&rdquo; Rosanna commented.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he doesn&rsquo;t know the combination.
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
I distrust him even more than I do
Caleb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, but I intend to watch them both,&rdquo;
Penny responded thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced
there&rsquo;s a deep plot brewing&mdash;something far
more sinister than we&rsquo;ve suspected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />A Night Adventure</h2>
<p>Since taking leave of Mr. Nichols at Mt.
Ashland, Penny had received no word
from her father. She did not worry actively,
yet it was a great relief when later in
the afternoon a uniformed messenger boy delivered
a telegram into her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remain as long as you wish,&rdquo; her father
wired. &ldquo;Am enjoying good rest here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From an upstairs window Mrs. Leeds had
noted the arrival of the messenger boy. She
came hurrying down to see if the message was
for her. While Penny read the communication,
the woman eyed her suspiciously.</p>
<p>At last her curiosity could no longer be restrained.
She asked carelessly: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
your wire has anything to do with Jacob Winters
or the estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only indirectly,&rdquo; Penny responded mischievously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>To avoid further questioning, the girls went
outdoors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if Caleb is at home,&rdquo; Penny proposed.</p>
<p>They rapped several times upon the door of
the cabin and were about to turn away, when
the old man opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to bother you,&rdquo; Penny apologized. &ldquo;I
wanted to ask a few more questions about Mr.
Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb looked ill at ease. &ldquo;Questions!&rdquo; he
fumed. &ldquo;Well, what is it you want to know this
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, isn&rsquo;t there a pipe organ on the third
floor of Mr. Winters&rsquo; house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Jacob was a talented musician.
He installed the organ nearly fifteen years ago.
But what of it may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like very much to see the organ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you look at it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t because the door is locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked?&rdquo; Caleb seemed surprised. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
funny. I didn&rsquo;t know Mr. Winters ever locked
up his conservatory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t a key?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I have a key?&rdquo; Caleb snorted.
&ldquo;You act as if I&rsquo;m the caretaker of that house.
It&rsquo;s nothing to me what goes on there, except
that I don&rsquo;t like to see folks overrun the place
and steal Mr. Winters&rsquo; fine things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look at us so accusingly,&rdquo; Rosanna
said with surprising spirit. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t
take or damage one single thing in that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb&rsquo;s face softened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to suggest that you would.
I believe you two girls aren&rsquo;t like those others.
But you were speaking of the organ. Why are
you so interested in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ve been hearing music at night,&rdquo;
Penny informed. &ldquo;It seems to come from that
room on the third floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb regarded her in awe. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s true,
the things they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo; Rosanna asked impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the house is haunted. If Mr. Winters
really is dead it may be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Penny cut in. &ldquo;Rosanna and I
don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts. And what&rsquo;s more, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
doubt if you do, Caleb Eckert! That so-called
ghost is a very live one. If you won&rsquo;t help me,
I&rsquo;ll solve the mystery alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this declaration, Penny stalked
from the cabin, followed by the faithful Rosanna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ve antagonized him now,&rdquo; the
latter said as they went back to the house on the
cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I have! Caleb knows a great
deal more than he pretends. He could help
us if he wanted to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one was stirring on the lower floor of the
Winters&rsquo; house when the girls entered. To
Penny it seemed an admirable time to institute
a search of the premises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let Mrs. Leeds hunt for the will,&rdquo;
Penny declared, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll look for something
which may prove equally valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Rosanna asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A picture of Jacob Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see what good it will do to find one
except that I&rsquo;d like to have a photo of my uncle
as a keepsake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If my plans work out I&rsquo;ll have a more important
use for it,&rdquo; Penny smiled mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think we could find one somewhere
in the house,&rdquo; Rosanna declared. &ldquo;Most people
have old photographs stuck around in odd
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For nearly an hour the girls poked about
in drawers and clothes closets until Rosanna
protested that she felt as prying and sneaking
as Mrs. Leeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is in a better cause,&rdquo; Penny laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way to us because it&rsquo;s my cause,&rdquo;
Rosanna smiled. &ldquo;Still, I&rsquo;d never examine private
papers or locked drawers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny made no response for in a lower table
drawer she had come upon an old album. She
displayed her discovery and page by page the
girls went through it, laughing a little at the
strange old-fashioned costumes and the stiff
poses of the subjects. Names were written under
a few of the photographs but Rosanna
recognized only one or two as relatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew many of my relation,&rdquo; she admitted.
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
&ldquo;If Mrs. Leeds and her daughter are
samples, perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people in this album look nice, Rosanna.
I suppose most of them are dead by this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned a page and stared blankly
down at an empty folder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here is your uncle&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; she cried,
indicating a signature at the bottom of the page.
&ldquo;But the photo is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how disappointing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone removed the photo, Rosanna. Perhaps
deliberately too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only said it. I have no evidence of course.
Oh, all my plans will be upset if I don&rsquo;t find the
photograph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrival of Mrs. Leeds cut short the conversation.
The girls hastily returned the album
to the table drawer but not quickly enough
to avoid being detected. Mrs. Leeds triumphantly
pounced on the leather bound book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only an old-fashioned album,&rdquo; she said in
disappointment, tossing it aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think it was the will?&rdquo; Penny
chuckled as she and Rosanna departed.</p>
<p>The girls impatiently awaited the coming of
night. Penny had determined to make a supreme
effort to discover the cause of the mysterious
organ music. At first Rosanna had been
enthusiastic over the plan but as nightfall approached
she tried to dissuade her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dangerous,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Please
give up the scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. She had made up her
mind to spend the night on the third floor.
Soon after the household retired she intended
to steal upstairs and establish herself by the door
of the conservatory.</p>
<p>Evening came. At nine Mrs. Leeds and her
daughter shut themselves into the bedroom
which they had selected since their upsetting
experience with bats. At eleven Penny heard
Max Laponi&rsquo;s door close.</p>
<p>She looked out into the hall. It was dark and
deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t attempt it,&rdquo; Rosanna shivered.
&ldquo;What if something should happen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it does,&rdquo; Penny said grimly. &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t be any fun to sit up half the night without
any purpose. I&rsquo;ll be disappointed if our
ghost fails to provide his usual midnight concert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything goes wrong scream for help,&rdquo;
Rosanna urged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run for assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny promised. While Rosanna stood at
the bedroom door watching, she tiptoed down
the hall, past Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; room, past Laponi&rsquo;s
chamber to the third floor stairs.</p>
<p>There she hesitated. Without a light the
region above looked even more dark and awe-inspiring
than she had remembered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; she accused herself, and quietly
went up, leaving the door unlocked behind her.</p>
<p>All was quiet on the third floor. Penny tried
the door to the conservatory expecting to find
it locked. To her astonishment it opened. The
discovery disconcerted her for an instant. A
minute later she mustered her courage and
stepped inside the room.</p>
<p>In the darkness she could make out objects
only vaguely. The organ with its huge pipes
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
occupied one end of the room. Sheet-draped
chairs gave everything a ghostly atmosphere not
at all conducive to a peaceful state of mind.</p>
<p>After making a brief inspection of her quarters
Penny sat down on the floor with her back
against the outside door. She riveted her eyes
upon the organ.</p>
<p>Time dragged slowly. When it seemed to
Penny that several hours must have passed, she
heard a clock downstairs striking eleven-thirty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least another half hour to wait,&rdquo; Penny
thought, shifting into a more comfortable position.</p>
<p>She grew drowsy. Several times she caught
herself on the verge of napping. She aroused
herself only to find her eyes growing heavy
again. It became increasingly difficult to watch
the organ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that ghost would hurry up and come,&rdquo;
she mused impatiently. &ldquo;Perhaps after all my
trouble this won&rsquo;t be one of his working nights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the last thought of which she was
aware. Suddenly she heard soft organ music
rolling and swelling about her. With a start
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
she aroused herself. She had been sleeping.</p>
<p>It took an instant for Penny to gather her
wits. She was still sitting with her back to the
conservatory door. Yet at the far end of the
great room, she distinctly could see a shadowy
figure seated at the organ.</p>
<p>Penny scrambled to her feet, starting forward.
The floor creaked alarmingly.</p>
<p>Penny halted, but too late. She had given
warning of her presence.</p>
<p>The shadowy figure at the organ jerked into
alert attention. There was a discordant crash
of chords, then silence.</p>
<p>Penny blinked. She thought she had heard
a sharp click as if a secret panel had opened and
closed. That was all.</p>
<p>And the organist had disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />A Suspicious Act</h2>
<p>Penny caught herself shivering. She decided
that she had seen quite enough for
one night.</p>
<p>She turned toward the door, but with her
hand on the brass knob, stood tensely listening.
Someone was tiptoeing along the hall. It occurred
to her that the mysterious organist
might have escaped from the music room by
means of a secret panel which opened directly
into the adjoining corridor. Even now he could
be effecting his escape to the lower floor.</p>
<p>Crouching against the wall, Penny waited.
She was startled to hear the footsteps coming
closer. Then the door opened a tiny crack and
the beam of a flashlight slowly circled the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny!&rdquo; an anxious voice whispered.
&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed in relief as she reached out
to grip Rosanna&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! How you startled me!&rdquo; the girl gasped.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re safe, Penny. You stayed up
here so long that I was frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to wait for the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the music,&rdquo; Rosanna said in awe.
&ldquo;It broke off so suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was because I frightened the ghost
away. At first I thought perhaps I had dreamed
it all, but if you heard the music too then it
must have been real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was real enough. But it lasted only a
minute or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the organist saw me I suspect he
slipped out of the room by means of a secret
panel,&rdquo; Penny reported. &ldquo;But where he went
is a mystery. You didn&rsquo;t see anyone as you
came up the stairs to find me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure no one was in the hall, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as certain as anything that this room has
a secret entrance. Give me your flashlight and
we&rsquo;ll see what we can discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not tonight,&rdquo; Rosanna shivered, pulling her
friend toward the door. &ldquo;We can come back
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The room may be locked again then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take advantage of the opportunity
while we have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna handed over the flashlight and together
they crossed the room to the big organ.
They inspected it with interest and Penny ran
her fingers lightly over the keys. However, no
sound came forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; Rosanna whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think someone has to pump air,&rdquo; Penny
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably shut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She next turned her attention to the walls in
the immediate vicinity of the organ. She could
locate no hidden panel although in one place
it seemed to her that when she rapped on a certain
sector it emitted a hollow sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dark to see anything tonight,&rdquo; Rosanna
protested nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we may as well give it up until morning,&rdquo;
Penny agreed.</p>
<p>The girls stole quietly down the stairs to the
lower floor. However, an unpleasant surprise
awaited them. As they opened the door into
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the main passageway they found themselves
face to face with Mrs. Leeds and Alicia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I find you here again!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed.
&ldquo;I suspected before that you girls
were at the bottom of these nightly disturbances.
Now I have the proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was too annoyed to even try to explain
why she had visited the third floor. She would
have ignored the woman and passed on to her
own room had not Rosanna been so distressed
by the ridiculous accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had absolutely nothing to do with
the queer things which have been going on in
this house,&rdquo; the orphan maintained indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why were you upstairs at this time of
night? Only a minute or two ago Alicia and
I heard music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were trying to learn what caused it,
Mrs. Leeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A likely story!&rdquo; Alicia said with a toss of her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may believe it or not, just as you wish,&rdquo;
Penny returned coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Miss Nichols, that you are
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
taking it upon yourself to do entirely too much
investigating,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds said cuttingly.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t your home and you&rsquo;re not a relative
of Jacob Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And unless I&rsquo;m sadly mistaken there are
others here who are similarly situated!&rdquo; Penny
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to suggest that Alicia and I
are not related to Jacob Winters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suggesting anything,&rdquo; Penny replied
evenly. &ldquo;However, since you brought up the
matter of an investigation, I might ask you about
that paper which I saw you burn in the living
room fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; face changed color and she grew
confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough, but we&rsquo;ll let it pass
for the time being. Come on, Rosanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls walked down the hall and entered
their own room, closing the door firmly
behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You held your own with her that time,&rdquo; Rosanna
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
chuckled. &ldquo;My, I wish I could talk up to
people the way you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talk entirely too much. But she made me
provoked when she accused us of causing all
the disturbance in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you mean by asking about a paper
she had burned?&rdquo; Rosanna asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just wanted to throw a scare into her,&rdquo;
Penny responded evasively as she snapped out
the light and crept into bed. &ldquo;I really have no
proof of anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long after Rosanna had fallen asleep she lay
awake thinking. Proof! The word seared itself
into her brain. If only she could secure
some evidence which would aid Rosanna!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entire affair seems unreal,&rdquo; she mused.
&ldquo;Almost like a movie. It&rsquo;s obvious that someone
is playing at being a ghost, trying to frighten
the occupants of this house. But what can be
the purpose behind it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Penny had been careful to make
no such admission to Rosanna, she was becoming
increasingly troubled. Nor were her worries
confined solely to the hide-and-seek organist.
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
She feared that the time was fast approaching
when Mrs. Leeds or Max Laponi would make
a legal claim to the Winters&rsquo; property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chances are that Mrs. Leeds destroyed
the will,&rdquo; she reasoned. &ldquo;In that event, Rosanna
may lose everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny felt baffled, yet she was unwilling to
admit defeat. Certainly not until Mrs. Leeds
had thrown all her cards on the table. Events
were fast approaching a crisis. Penny sensed
that from the woman&rsquo;s attitude of increasing
hostility and assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not defeated yet,&rdquo; she thought grimly
as she closed her eyes and tried to sleep. &ldquo;I still
have a few tricks up my sleeve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Rosanna and Penny descended the
stairs the next morning they heard a murmur
of voices in the library. The door was closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine Laponi and Mrs. Leeds are having
another one of their secret conferences,&rdquo; Penny
commented. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re up to some mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not leave this place today?&rdquo; Rosanna
demanded, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about the fortune any
more. I&rsquo;m so tired of all this plotting and
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
scheming. I&rsquo;d rather just go away and let them
have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t look so distressed,&rdquo; Penny smiled.
&ldquo;The battle of wits has only begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like to battle. It isn&rsquo;t my nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your appointed gladiator, Rosanna.
You have no idea how much pleasure it would
give me to see these grasping imposters exposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any proof they&rsquo;re imposters,&rdquo;
Rosanna said soberly. &ldquo;After all, they had letters
and keys to the house. I haven&rsquo;t even that
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad they were lost, but you mustn&rsquo;t
let it worry you,&rdquo; Penny chided. &ldquo;Right now
I&rsquo;m more concerned over another matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mysterious ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, although I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that at
the moment. It&rsquo;s Mr. Winters&rsquo; photograph.
Who tore it out of the album?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all we know it may have been removed
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so, but somehow I have a hunch
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
it disappeared at a far more recent date. If I
don&rsquo;t find a picture of Jacob Winters, I&rsquo;m afraid
my little plan will fall through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me much about this secret
plan of yours, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I haven&rsquo;t worked it out clearly
in my own mind yet. But unless I find the
photograph there simply won&rsquo;t be any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might search the house again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to do that if we can ever find a time
when Mrs. Leeds and Max Laponi are both
gone. Just now I&rsquo;m eager to make another inspection
of the organ room upstairs. This is
our chance while those two are closeted in the
library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna was not especially anxious to visit
the third floor again, but she offered no objection
to the suggestion. Penny led the way up
the creaking stairs.</p>
<p>The door of the music room was unlocked
as they had left it the previous evening. However,
the window shades were all drawn and the
room was dark. Penny raised the blinds to admit
light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Curiously, the girls gazed about them. Everything
was covered with a thick coating of dust
and cobwebs hung in misty veils from the corners
of the room. Penny crossed over to the
organ. She indicated the bench in front of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that proves whether or not our ghost
was real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the imprint on the dusty surface
of the organ bench?&rdquo; Rosanna asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can see where the organist sat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps one of us brushed off the dust without
realizing it. You tried to play a few notes
on the organ, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t sit down on the bench,
Rosanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Losing interest in the organ, Penny began to
search for the secret panel through which she
was firmly convinced that the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; had disappeared.
As her eyes moved swiftly over the
smooth wall, she suddenly uttered a low exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Rosanna! The imprint of a man&rsquo;s
hand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>The marking upon the wall was so faint that
at first the other girl did not see it. But she
too became excited as Penny pointed it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you suppose it came to be there?&rdquo;
she asked in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect our friend the organist was groping
about in the dark searching for the secret
panel. No doubt his hand was dusty and when
he pressed it against the wall it left a faint imprint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re right, we have a valuable clue as
to the location of the panel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded eagerly. Already she was exploring
the wall with her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; she murmured impatiently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as sure as anything that the panel is
here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off suddenly as her fingers touched
a tiny round object which was hidden under the
wall paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; she exclaimed gleefully
pressing the button.</p>
<p>The girls heard a faint click. But the panel
did not open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The stubborn thing!&rdquo; Penny cried impatiently.
&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t it open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pushed with both hands against the section
of wall where she felt convinced the panel
was located. To her own surprise and the horror
of her companion, it suddenly gave way.</p>
<p>Penny plunged headlong through the opening.
And before Rosanna could recover from
the shock of seeing her friend disappear, the
panel fell back into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, Penny,&rdquo; she cried anxiously, pounding
upon the wall. &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several minutes there was no answer.
Then Rosanna heard a smothered little giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my bones are still together I guess. But
I seem to have tumbled down a flight of stairs.
Come on in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to get in. The panel
slammed shut when you fell through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hinged at the top I think. Find the
little button and press on it. Then when you
hear a click push on the panel. Only push easy
or you&rsquo;ll take a tumble the way I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a minute Rosanna had located the button.
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
She pressed upon it as she had seen Penny do.
Then as the lock clicked, she cautiously pushed
against the panel. Light as was her touch the
sector of wall swung instantly back and she
stepped through the opening. So concerned
was she over Penny that she failed to hear the
panel close behind her.</p>
<p>At first Rosanna could see nothing. Then
as her eyes became accustomed to the gloomy
interior she made out a long flight of stone steps
leading downward into inky blackness.</p>
<p>She felt reassured when Penny grasped her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Rosanna! Isn&rsquo;t it exciting? Let&rsquo;s
explore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s too dark!&rdquo; Rosanna whispered
nervously. &ldquo;What if we should run into that
dreadful man&mdash;the organist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it would be wiser to go back
for a flashlight,&rdquo; Penny conceded. &ldquo;Only we
mustn&rsquo;t let Mrs. Leeds or Max Laponi suspect
what we&rsquo;re up to. We must keep this discovery
strictly to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned to the head of the stairs but
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
although she groped her hand carefully along
the wall she could find no hidden button or
spring which controlled the panel. By this time
Rosanna had grown frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me we&rsquo;re locked in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny forced herself to speak calmly. She
knew that it would never do to let Rosanna
realize that she too was alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the moment I&rsquo;m afraid we are,&rdquo; she admitted
quietly. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t give up hope.
We&rsquo;ll get out of here somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />The Secret Stairs</h2>
<p>Ten minutes of unrewarded search convinced
Penny that they were only wasting
their time in attempting to locate the
hidden spring without a light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow the steps down and see where
they lead,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Surely there must
be another exit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna permitted Penny to lead her down
the steep flight of stairs. They presently
reached the bottom. It was too dark to see very
much but by feeling along the damp stone wall
they discovered that they were in a narrow passageway.
As they moved cautiously forward a
breath of cold air struck Penny&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the way to the exit,&rdquo; she declared
cheerfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be out of here
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be too soon for me,&rdquo; Rosanna chattered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Hand in hand they groped their way along
the subterranean passage. Soon they came to
the end of it but instead of an exit they found
another flight of steps leading downward at a
steep angle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful or you&rsquo;ll fall,&rdquo; Penny warned as they
began the treacherous descent. &ldquo;Some of the
stones are loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had a light,&rdquo; Rosanna complained.
&ldquo;Where do you suppose we&rsquo;re going anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe to the center of the earth,&rdquo; Penny
chuckled. &ldquo;It seems like it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m mixed up in my directions we&rsquo;re
moving toward the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that way to me too,&rdquo; Penny readily
agreed. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve twisted and turned so many
times I couldn&rsquo;t be sure of anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the girls were convinced that they
were underground for they had made a long,
straight descent. The walls were moist and
damp; the air chilly. Yet one thing puzzled
them. If they actually were traveling toward
the lake that meant that the tunnel had been
bored into the side of the cliff. But such a feat
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
obviously was nothing less than an engineering
enterprise.</p>
<p>At length the girls reached the bottom of the
second flight of stairs only to find themselves in
another passageway. It was much larger than
the other and lighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we could be in an abandoned
ore mine?&rdquo; Penny suddenly demanded, pausing
to inspect the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look a little like it. Only I never
heard of stone steps in a mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they have shafts. But it strikes me that
the steps may have been added later, if you
noticed, the upper passage was much smaller
than this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if it had been dug out to join with this
one,&rdquo; Rosanna added eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. It&rsquo;s my theory that some person
knew about this old mine and decided to connect
it with a smaller tunnel which would lead
up into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who do you suppose conceived such a
plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that one,&rdquo; Penny laughed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
&ldquo;But come on, let&rsquo;s see if we aren&rsquo;t approaching
the exit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly they moved forward, guided by the
streak of light. A minute later Penny who was
in the lead, gave a joyous shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to the end of it! I can see
trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness,&rdquo; Rosanna sighed in relief.
&ldquo;I was afraid we&rsquo;d never get out alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny parted the bushes which barred the
exit and they peered out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right, Rosanna. We did travel
toward the lake. We&rsquo;re almost in it for that
matter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water came within a few yards of the
entrance and during a storm the girls imagined
that it must flood the lower passageway. Penny
noticed a rowboat tied up in a clump of bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s how our ghost makes his
quick get-away,&rdquo; Penny remarked dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might take a ride on the lake,&rdquo; Rosanna
proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it might advertise that
we&rsquo;ve discovered this tunnel? Especially if the
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
ghost should happen to see us using his boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I didn&rsquo;t stop to think. Oh, Penny
if only we knew the identity of this person who
annoys the household!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be so hard to learn it now,&rdquo;
Penny declared in satisfaction. &ldquo;At night we&rsquo;ll
station ourselves here by the mouth of the
tunnel and watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if it should turn out
to be Max Laponi,&rdquo; Rosanna remarked. &ldquo;He
never seems to be in his room at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny offered no response.</p>
<p>Fearing that their long absence from the
house might have aroused suspicion, the girls
hurriedly left the scene. They found a trail
which wound along the base of the cliff and
which presently took them toward the house on
the hill.</p>
<p>As they passed the Eckert cabin they saw the
old man cleaning fish by the back door. They
greeted him perfunctorily and would have
walked on had he not seemed in a mood to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out early this morning, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were down by the lake,&rdquo; Penny
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have crawled out of bed before
the sun was up. I&rsquo;ve been cleaning fish here all
morning and I didn&rsquo;t see you go past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went around a different way,&rdquo; Penny
answered, and then before he could ask another
question, interposed one of her own. &ldquo;By the
way, do you know where I could get a picture
of Jacob Winters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Caleb dropped his fish knife. It took
him a long time to recover it from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want of a picture?&rdquo; he questioned
gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just need it,&rdquo; Penny said evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have one myself,&rdquo; Rosanna added
sincerely. &ldquo;I never had a photo of my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you find he&rsquo;s cut you out of all his property
I guess you probably won&rsquo;t be so anxious
to have a picture of the old cod,&rdquo; Caleb observed.</p>
<p>Rosanna drew herself up proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t make the slightest difference,
Mr. Eckert. After all, my uncle never saw me
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
so why should he have left me any of his money?
You say such disagreeable things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a disagreeable old man,&rdquo; Caleb admitted
cheerfully, &ldquo;but my bark is worse than my bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, please don&rsquo;t call my uncle names,&rdquo;
Rosanna went on with spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke of Uncle Jacob as an old cod. I
don&rsquo;t like it a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Caleb was startled by the outburst. But
his eyes twinkled as he replied soberly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, Miss Rosanna, I didn&rsquo;t mean to
offend you or to speak disrespectfully of Jacob
either. It was just my way of talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll forgive you,&rdquo; Rosanna smiled.</p>
<p>The girls were on the verge of moving off
when Caleb checked them with a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard Mrs. Leeds or that Laponi
fellow say anything about leaving have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they intend to go unless
they&rsquo;re put out,&rdquo; Penny responded. &ldquo;I heard
Mrs. Leeds say the other day that she had sent
for her lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They stick tighter than cockle burs,&rdquo; Caleb
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
commented. &ldquo;If only I had the right, I would
send them both packing. Especially that Max
Laponi. I don&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; Penny agreed promptly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I think you should try to help me
clear up this dreadful muddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do? I have no authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will help if you can find me a photograph
of Mr. Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb&rsquo;s face puckered into troubled wrinkles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; he muttered under his breath.
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that you said?&rdquo; Penny questioned
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. I was just talking to myself.
About the picture. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. Don&rsquo;t
count much on getting it though because I
doubt if I can locate one for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls chatted a few minutes longer but
Caleb was not very good company. He responded
briefly if at all to their conversational
sallies and for the most part seemed lost in
thought. They soon left him to his fish cleaning
and went on toward the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what got into him all at once?&rdquo;
Rosanna mused. &ldquo;Perhaps he was offended at
the way I spoke to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he gave it a second thought,&rdquo;
Penny responded. &ldquo;I suspect Caleb rather likes
to have folks talk up to him. No, I&rsquo;m sure it
wasn&rsquo;t anything you said that annoyed him.
Likely enough it was my request for Mr. Winters&rsquo;
photograph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should that bother him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know. Caleb is a
queer one to say the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll ever produce the photo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a great surprise to me if he did.
And yet from the way he acted, I&rsquo;m convinced
he could get me one if he chose. Like as not he
has one in his cabin now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny lapsed into a moody silence. From
the day of her arrival at Raven Ridge she had
sensed old Caleb&rsquo;s reluctance to help her.
While she could not say that he was exactly unfriendly
he had made no positive move of assistance.
She had believed for a long time that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
knew a great deal more than he would tell regarding
Jacob Winters&rsquo; absence.</p>
<p>The girls entered the house by a side door.
They noticed that Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; car no longer
stood on the driveway and took it for granted
that she and her daughter had driven to Andover
as was their daily custom.</p>
<p>They glanced casually into the library and
noticed that it was empty. However, Penny&rsquo;s
keen eyes traveled to the desk. She observed
that the ink bottle had been left uncorked and
that a pen had been removed from its holder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Mrs. Leeds and Laponi were
up to?&rdquo; she speculated. &ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;ll probably
find out soon enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll go upstairs for a few minutes,&rdquo;
Rosanna excused herself. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t straightened
my things yet this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Left alone, Penny crossed over to the desk
and examined the paper in the wastebasket.
She looked closely at the blotter, even holding it
to the mirror, but it had been used so many
times that the words which appeared upon it
could not be read. There was not a scrap of
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
evidence to show what Mrs. Leeds and Max
Laponi had been writing.</p>
<p>In disappointment Penny picked up a book
and sat down to read. Presently she heard soft
steps in the hallway but paid slight attention
thinking that it was Rosanna.</p>
<p>She was on the verge of calling her friend&rsquo;s
name when she thought better of it. The sound
of the footsteps told her that the person had
gone into the living room. And by this time
she was convinced that it was not Rosanna.</p>
<p>She waited, listening. She heard a faint
metallic click which caused her to lay aside her
book and quietly steal to the doorway of the
living room.</p>
<p>Max Laponi stood with his back toward her,
so absorbed in what he was about that he had
not the slightest suspicion that he was being
observed.</p>
<p>Penny saw him carefully remove the oil painting
from the wall. He deftly opened the panel,
exposing the safe. Then, with a sureness of
touch which amazed Penny, he began to spin the
dials.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />A Diamond Ring</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Laponi, kindly move away from
that safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny spoke sharply as she quietly
stepped into the living room. The man whirled
and saw her. Taken by surprise, his hand fell
away from the dials and he looked confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be very much interested in Mr.
Winters&rsquo; valuables,&rdquo; Penny said sternly.</p>
<p>By this time Max Laponi had recovered his
composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;After
all, I am Mr. Winters&rsquo; heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen, Mr. Laponi. You
appear to be very handy at opening safes, I
notice.&rdquo; Penny crossed the room and after
turning the handle to make certain that Laponi
had not succeeded in his purpose, closed the
panel and returned the oil painting to its
former position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think I was trying to steal,&rdquo;
Laponi began after a minute of dead silence.
&ldquo;Nothing was further from my intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since I caught Caleb Eckert trying to
break into this safe I&rsquo;ve been worried. Last
night I saw him prowling around the house
after dark and it made me uneasy. I was afraid
he would make another attempt to steal Mr.
Winters&rsquo; valuables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you thought you would just beat him to
it!&rdquo; Penny retorted sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. When you entered the room
I was merely inspecting the safe to make certain
that it was securely locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny could not refrain from smiling. She
did not believe a word of what Max Laponi was
telling her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That safe seems to be the real attraction of
this house,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suspected for
some time that it contains Mr. Winters&rsquo; ivory
collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Max Laponi were taken aback he did not
disclose it. But he eyed Penny shrewdly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart little girl. Too smart to go
around making trouble for yourself. Now if
you&rsquo;re wise you&rsquo;ll team up with me and I&rsquo;ll
promise you that you&rsquo;ll come out at the top of
the heap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what is your proposition?&rdquo; Penny asked
quickly.</p>
<p>Max Laponi was too alert to place himself in
any trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to follow my orders I&rsquo;ll
promise you that when I come into my fortune
you&rsquo;ll be well paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are your orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you after you give me your promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny regarded him coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise nothing, Mr. Laponi, except
that I intend to see justice done to Rosanna
Winters! You and Mrs. Leeds are trying to
cheat her out of her rightful inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never get a cent. If you had an ounce
of sense you&rsquo;d ditch her and come in with us.
It&rsquo;s all fixed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fixed!&rdquo; Penny tripped him. &ldquo;And by &lsquo;us&rsquo; I
imagine you mean Mrs. Leeds. You&rsquo;re both
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
hatching some scheme to defraud Rosanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laponi smiled impudently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t give you your choice,
Miss Nichols. It is your decision to have no
share in the spoils?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laponi&rsquo;s face darkened slightly. &ldquo;As you
wish, Miss Nichols. But let me give you a little
warning. Keep your nose out of my affairs or it
will be the worse for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and walked from the room. A
minute later Penny saw him leave the house by
the side door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he thinks he can frighten me with a threat
he has another guess coming!&rdquo; she thought indignantly.
&ldquo;For two cents I&rsquo;d call in the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon second consideration she decided that
such a move would not be wise. After all she
had no real evidence against Laponi. While
she was convinced in her own mind that his
motives were dishonest the police might take a
more conservative attitude. Then too, she
would be forced to offer a satisfactory explanation
for her own presence in the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Laponi is after something more valuable
than a will,&rdquo; Penny mused as she stood at the
window watching his car vanish down the driveway.</p>
<p>Her eye wandered to the oil painting on the
wall. She felt certain that the safe which was
screened beneath it guarded Mr. Winters&rsquo; collection
of ivory. And from the expression of
Laponi&rsquo;s face when she had mentioned her belief,
she was sure that he shared the same conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He practically admitted he was involved
in some scheme to defraud Rosanna,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling he&rsquo;s a crook even
if he is a relative of Mr. Winters. I wish I
dared search his room for evidence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more she considered the idea, the greater
became its appeal. Probably Laponi would not
return to the house for at least an hour. She
would have ample time. Still, the undertaking
would be a risky one and not at all to her
liking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose a professional detective wouldn&rsquo;t
feel squeamish about entering another person&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
room if the case demanded it,&rdquo; she encouraged
herself. &ldquo;Laponi practically admitted his guilt&mdash;that
was because he thought I couldn&rsquo;t do anything
about it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll show him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Penny&rsquo;s mind was made up.
Quietly she stole up the stairway. In the upper
corridor she paused to listen for a minute.
Everything was still.</p>
<p>Penny tiptoed down the hall to Max Laponi&rsquo;s
room. She tried the door. It was locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He must keep
something inside that he&rsquo;s afraid to have folks
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was more eager than before to search the
room. But with the key gone it seemed out
of the question. Then Penny&rsquo;s face lighted as
she recalled the empty bedroom adjoining the
one occupied by Laponi. It was possible that
they might have a connecting door.</p>
<p>Looking carefully about to make certain that
she was not under observation, she moved on
down the hall and tried the next door. To her
delight it opened. She entered the dusty
chamber, gazing quickly about. She was disappointed
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
to see that the two bedrooms had no
connecting door.</p>
<p>However, when she walked to the window
and raised it, she noted a wide ledge which ran
the length of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I dared lower myself to it I could
reach Max Laponi&rsquo;s room, for the ledge is only
a few feet below from his window!&rdquo; she reasoned.</p>
<p>Penny decided that the chance was worth
taking. She naturally was athletic and had
confidence that she could maintain a foothold.
Lowering herself to the ledge she flattened herself
to the wall of the house and moved an inch
at a time toward the next window.
It was a long fall to the ground. Penny did
not dare glance downward. Although the distance
between the two windows was not more
than twelve feet it seemed an age until her hands
clutched the sill.</p>
<p>As she pried at the window a sudden fear
assailed her. What if it too were locked?</p>
<p>The window had only stuck a little. A quick
jerk brought it up. By sheer strength of muscle,
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Penny raised herself to the level of the sill,
swinging her feet through the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must work fast,&rdquo; she told herself, glancing
appraisingly about. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not care to be caught
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her attention was drawn to Max Laponi&rsquo;s
open suitcase which had been left carelessly on
the bed. Crossing over to it she began to explore
the contents systematically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hunch about Laponi may have been
wrong,&rdquo; she thought uncomfortably as the
search revealed nothing of interest.</p>
<p>Just then her hand touched something hard
and cold. Penny knew instantly that it was a
revolver. She was not afraid of firearms for her
father had taught her to shoot. Carefully she
inspected the weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this heavy artillery must have been
brought here for a purpose,&rdquo; she reflected
grimly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear Laponi is out to get what he
wants by one means or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After an instant&rsquo;s hesitation Penny placed the
revolver on the table. She had decided to take
it with her when she left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Things in this house are fast approaching a
crisis,&rdquo; she reasoned. &ldquo;Before I get through I
may need that weapon myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Save for an inner pocket in the suitcase, Penny
had completed her inspection. She ran her
hand into the cloth pouch and brought to light
several papers. Rapidly she went through them.</p>
<p>Suddenly she uttered a cry of delight. She
had discovered the letter which Max Laponi
claimed had been sent him by the same lawyer
who had notified Rosanna of her newly inherited
fortune.</p>
<p>Although Laponi, upon his arrival at Raven
Ridge, had flourished the document, he had permitted
no one to inspect it closely.</p>
<p>Now as Penny read the letter carefully she recalled
that the wording was identical with the
message which Rosanna had received. Closely
she studied the salutation, holding the paper to
the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the name has been changed!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Max Laponi has cleverly removed
Rosanna&rsquo;s name and substituted his own. This
must be the letter which Rosanna lost!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>It occurred to her that the man doubtlessly
had found the missing key as well. She again
ran her hand into the cloth pocket and triumphantly
brought it forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing but a rank impostor!&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep this letter as evidence against
him and the key will come in handy too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hastily rearranged the suitcase as she
had found it and prepared to depart. The
search had well repaid her for her efforts, but
it had taken longer than she had intended.</p>
<p>However, as she crossed the room toward the
window she noticed a number of small objects
spread out over the dresser and could not resist
pausing to inspect them. They held her interest
only briefly.</p>
<p>She turned away again but as she moved off
a button on her sleeve caught in the lace work
of the runner which covered the dresser top. It
pulled awry and Penny paused to straighten it.</p>
<p>As she rearranged the piece, her fingers
touched a small hard object on the under side.
Her curiosity aroused she turned back the runner
and looked beneath it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>There lay a diamond ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A diamond!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;As big as a
house too. It&rsquo;s evidently been hidden here by
Max Laponi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked it up and examined it, reflecting
that somewhere she had seen a similar piece of
jewelry. She was certain the diamond was not
an imitation for it sparkled brightly. However,
she had no opportunity to give it more than a
hasty glance for she was startled to hear footsteps
coming down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Laponi may be coming back,&rdquo; she
thought nervously.</p>
<p>Leaving the diamond ring where she had discovered
it she hastily rearranged the dresser
cover. With her newly acquired evidence, she
darted to the window and lowered herself to the
outside ledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />Penny&rsquo;s Evidence</h2>
<p>The bedroom door opened and Max Laponi
entered.</p>
<p>Penny Nichols had lowered herself to
the narrow ledge not an instant too soon. There
had been no time to pull the window down after
her.</p>
<p>As she heard the man walk across the room
she huddled fearfully against the wall, feeling
certain that he would notice the open window
immediately. Her position was a precarious
one. She dared not move lest even a slight
sound betray her to the man inside. On the
other hand, it was doubtful how long she could
remain where she was without losing her footing.
She knew that if she once glanced downward
her courage would fail her.</p>
<p>Penny could hear Laponi muttering to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I left that window down,&rdquo; she
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
heard him say. &ldquo;If anyone has been in here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crossed to the bed and ran his hand under
the pillow. Penny peeped through the window
just as he removed a shiny object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another revolver!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one
I missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sight of the weapon seemed to reassure
Laponi for he appeared relieved. He next
crossed over to the bureau and searched for the
diamond ring. Penny was very glad that she
had not touched it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess everything is the same as I left it,&rdquo;
the man muttered to himself. &ldquo;Still, I&rsquo;d have
sworn I left that window down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny huddled flat against the wall, he
moved over toward it. She held her breath,
waiting. Would he look out? If he did, then
all was lost.</p>
<p>Laponi stood for some minutes at the open
window, seemingly absorbed in his thoughts.
Then he abruptly slammed it down and turned
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a narrow escape!&rdquo; Penny congratulated
herself. &ldquo;If I ever get out of this mess I&rsquo;ll
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
take care not to get myself into another position
like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cautiously crept along the ledge until at
last she was able to stretch out her hand and
grasp the sill of the next window. After pulling
herself through she quietly closed it behind her.
Then she tiptoed to the bedroom door and
looked out. No one was in sight.</p>
<p>Carefully secreting the articles which she had
taken from Laponi&rsquo;s room, she darted past his
door and safely on to the bedroom which she
shared with Rosanna. The latter arose as she
burst in upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you startled me, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was due for another shock as Penny
dropped the revolver upon the dresser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, where did you get that thing?&rdquo; she
demanded nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud or someone may hear you,&rdquo;
Penny warned. &ldquo;It came from Laponi&rsquo;s room,
and that&rsquo;s not all I found either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew forth the letter and the missing key.
Rosanna stared incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely they can&rsquo;t be mine, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect they are. Take a look at this letter
and tell me if you notice anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna studied the letter briefly, then shook
her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It reads just like the one I received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point. Notice the name at the
top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it looks as if it might have been
changed!&rdquo; Rosanna cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think it has been. It&rsquo;s my opinion
that Max Laponi found your letter and the missing
key. He&rsquo;s a rank impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe he is the one who has been
frightening the household by playing on the
pipe organ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind about that yet,&rdquo;
Penny returned thoughtfully. &ldquo;But one thing
I&rsquo;m certain about. Laponi is a dangerous man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get away from here right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed shortly. &ldquo;I should say not!
This mystery is growing more exciting every
minute. I mean to discover Max Laponi&rsquo;s little
game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he may harm us,&rdquo; Rosanna protested.
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
&ldquo;Especially if he suspects you&rsquo;ve searched his
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laponi is armed,&rdquo; Penny admitted with a
frown. &ldquo;But for that matter so are we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare to carry that revolver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I most certainly would. Not that I&rsquo;d care
to use it, but it might serve as protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me we should call in the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;Not yet. But I do
intend to wire my father. I&rsquo;m going to ask him
to learn all he can about Laponi. It may turn
out that the man has a prison record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suspect that because you found the revolver
in his room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, honest citizens don&rsquo;t carry weapons
without permits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of doing it,&rdquo; Rosanna challenged.</p>
<p>Penny laughed. &ldquo;This is an extra special
emergency. But I have another reason for believing
that Laponi is a crook. I suspect he has
a stolen ring in his possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then told of finding the diamond ring
under the dresser scarf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All diamonds look somewhat alike,&rdquo; she acknowledged,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen that ring
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Bresham&rsquo;s Department Store. I think
it&rsquo;s the same ring that was stolen the afternoon
I met you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laponi does bear a slight resemblance to the
shoplifter,&rdquo; Rosanna admitted thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Only the store thief was a much older man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disguised perhaps. Oh, I may be wrong,
but at least it will do no harm to have Father
look into the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he gets your wire, Penny, he&rsquo;ll probably
be so alarmed that he&rsquo;ll send word for you
to start back to Mt. Ashland at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Dad. He&rsquo;d rather catch a crook than
eat. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you send the wire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right away. I&rsquo;d like to leave the house before
Laponi sees me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, as the girls stepped out into the
hall a few minutes later they heard loud voices
coming up from the living room. Penny instantly
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
recognized Laponi&rsquo;s sharp tones and
paused at the top of the stairs to peer down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Max and Caleb Eckert,&rdquo; she reported in
a whisper. &ldquo;My, what a quarrel they&rsquo;re having!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls listened for a minute but the voices
of the two men died to a low murmur and they
could distinguish only an occasional word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you want Laponi to see you we&rsquo;d
better slip down the back way,&rdquo; Rosanna suggested.</p>
<p>Using the rear stairs the girls were able to
leave the house without being observed. They
drove directly to Andover where Penny dispatched
a lengthy wire to her father. She requested
him to learn all he could concerning
Max Laponi and if possible to send her
a complete description of the diamond ring
which had been stolen from the department
store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why Caleb and Max Laponi were
going at each other in such dreadful fashion?&rdquo;
Rosanna mused as they drove back toward the
Winters&rsquo; mansion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Penny had been pondering over the same
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Caleb may be suspicious of
him,&rdquo; Rosanna went on when Penny did not
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. Old Caleb hasn&rsquo;t acted too honestly
himself, Rosanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he hasn&rsquo;t. He doesn&rsquo;t like to answer
questions and his interest in Mr. Winters&rsquo; safe
is rather puzzling. It seems to me that everyone
at Raven Ridge acts queerly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including me?&rdquo; Penny teased.</p>
<p>Rosanna laughed and squeezed her arm affectionately.
&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t mean you.
You&rsquo;ve been wonderful and I&rsquo;ll never never be
able to repay you for all you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, so far I&rsquo;ve accomplished exactly
nothing. But I have a feeling that before another
twenty-four hours elapse things are going
to start breaking for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Rosanna sighed.</p>
<p>Neither Max Laponi nor Caleb Eckert were
in the living room when the girls returned to
the house. Alicia was reading a book by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
fireplace but at sight of Penny and Rosanna she
coldly withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Penny smiled. &ldquo;It
clears the atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we stay here tonight?&rdquo; Rosanna asked.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we go to a hotel and come back in the
morning? Since I know that Max Laponi&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off as Penny shot her a warning
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the walls seem to have ears in this
house, Rosanna. Come outside and we&rsquo;ll do
our planning there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went out into the yard and sat down on
a stone bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a dreadful coward,&rdquo; Rosanna
acknowledged. &ldquo;Only I&rsquo;m so afraid something
terrible is about to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t let your nerves get the best of
you,&rdquo; Penny advised kindly. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have
shown you that revolver I found in Laponi&rsquo;s
room. You haven&rsquo;t been the same since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t just the revolver. It&rsquo;s everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was silent for a moment. Then she
said quietly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for feeling the way you
do. Perhaps we are taking a chance to remain
here tonight. I shouldn&rsquo;t do it only I feel that
it will give me an opportunity to clear up the
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you suspect Max&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do suspect him of a great many things, but
I&rsquo;m not certain of his game yet, Rosanna. Besides,
I must have absolute proof before I dare
notify the police. Tonight I intend to watch
the mouth of the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t permit you to do it by yourself. If
you insist on taking such a chance I&rsquo;ll go with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny remonstrated but at length it was
agreed that shortly after nightfall the two would
steal down to the lake&rsquo;s edge and lie in wait at
the mouth of the tunnel for the mysterious
ghost to appear.</p>
<p>For a long time the two girls sat staring out
across the lake, each absorbed with her own
thoughts. What would the night bring forth?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll walk down to Caleb Eckert&rsquo;s
cabin and chat with him for a few minutes,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
Penny remarked a little later as her companion
arose from the bench. &ldquo;Want to come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think I&rsquo;ll go inside. The air is growing
chilly and my sweater is upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to wait for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I believe I&rsquo;ll just rest.
You go on alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. But I doubt if you&rsquo;ll find
Caleb at home. He usually goes fishing about
this time of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I may as well see anyhow. I want to
ask him about that picture of Jacob Winters. I
intend to keep annoying him until he gives
me a satisfactory answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Rosanna returned to the house, Penny
walked swiftly in the direction of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only wasting my time,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Caleb has no intention of ever producing that
photograph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny rapped on the door, noticing that it
was partly ajar. There was no response. She
knocked a second time.</p>
<p>Far out on the lake she could see a small rowboat
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
with one lone fisherman. No doubt it was
Caleb, she decided.</p>
<p>She started away from the cabin, then abruptly
halted as she was struck with a sudden
thought. With Caleb out on the lake she would
have an excellent opportunity to search his shack
for the photograph of Jacob Winters. She felt
convinced she would find it there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entering people&rsquo;s private quarters seems to
be a bad habit of mine,&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;Still,
it&rsquo;s all in a good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny surveyed the lake again. The rowboat
was nearly out of sight.</p>
<p>After a moment of indecision, she pushed
open the cabin door and entered. Caleb had
left everything in a clutter and she scarcely knew
where to begin her search.</p>
<p>She looked in the desk and in several table
drawers. She searched in the magazine rack and
even in the kitchen cupboard. She was growing
discouraged when she finally opened a closet
and peered up at the high shelves. Far above
her head was a stack of old papers.</p>
<p>Although Penny had given up hope of finding
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
the picture, she brought a chair and climbing
up on it, took down the papers.</p>
<p>As she lifted the stack, an object which had
been lying on the shelf was brushed to the floor.
She bent down to pick it up. To her amazement
and delight it was a photograph.</p>
<p>She stared in disbelief at the man&rsquo;s face and
then turned the photo over to read what had
been written on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Jacob Winters.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Caleb told me he didn&rsquo;t know where
he could get a photograph!&rdquo; Penny thought indignantly.
&ldquo;All the time he had this one hidden
here on the shelf. Why, I&rsquo;m positive this picture
came out of the album Rosanna and I
found. Very likely Caleb tore it out himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily replacing the papers on the shelf,
Penny tucked the photograph into her pocket
and prepared to leave the cabin. She was highly
elated over her discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will prove quite a valuable addition to
my collection of evidence,&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;No
wonder Caleb was afraid to have me see it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; Strategy</h2>
<p>Penny was highly jubilant as she walked
rapidly toward the house on the hill. The
day had been an unusually successful one
for her and with the photograph of Jacob Winters
in her possession she felt that it would only
be a matter of time until the mystery was
solved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must act quickly or it may be too late,&rdquo;
she thought.</p>
<p>Drawing near the house she saw Rosanna
hurrying to meet her. Penny quickened her
step as she observed that the girl appeared
greatly agitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny,&rdquo; Rosanna gasped, &ldquo;Mrs. Leeds
has locked me out of the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I tried to get in after leaving you a
few minutes ago she met me at the front door.
She said I couldn&rsquo;t come in because the house
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
and everything surrounding it belongs to her
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed shortly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been saying
that ever since she came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but this is different, Penny. She
has the will to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she showed it to me. And it&rsquo;s true. My
uncle left all his property to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did she claim to have found this
document?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, somewhere in the house. I was so
upset I didn&rsquo;t think to inquire. Now that I
know Uncle Jacob left everything to her, I shall
leave at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny caught Rosanna by the arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be in too much of a hurry to get away,&rdquo; she advised.
&ldquo;It may be that Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; claims are
false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw the will for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was forged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; Rosanna gasped.
&ldquo;Do you think she would resort to such a
trick?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe she&rsquo;d do almost anything to gain a
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had been thinking swiftly. She recalled
the secretive actions of Mrs. Leeds and
Max Laponi when they were closeted together
in the library. They had been engrossed in
writing a document of some sort. Doubtless
it was the will which Mrs. Leeds now claimed to
have found.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s face puckered into a worried frown.
Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; unexpected action might complicate
the entire situation and ruin her own plans.
She feared too that the woman actually had
destroyed Jacob Winters&rsquo; true will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was burning it in the fireplace that day
when I came upon her,&rdquo; Penny thought.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why she feels so safe about forging
another one in her own favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you saying?&rdquo; Rosanna inquired.</p>
<p>Penny had not realized that she was speaking
aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only thinking,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go
in and talk with Mrs. Leeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t get in for she has locked all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
doors. Our luggage is sitting out on the porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very considerate of her I must say,&rdquo; Penny
grinned. &ldquo;But we can get in all right.&rdquo; She
produced the key which she had found in Max
Laponi&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you smart to keep it!&rdquo; Rosanna
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen. But come on, let&rsquo;s
beard Mrs. Leeds in her den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny boldly walked up to the front door. It
was locked as Rosanna had said, so inserting her
key she opened it.</p>
<p>As the girls entered, they heard Alicia calling
shrilly to her mother and an instant later Mrs.
Leeds came storming into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this outrage?&rdquo; she
demanded furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what we should like to know,&rdquo; Penny
retorted. &ldquo;Why did you lock us out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because this is my house. Jacob Winters
left everything to me and I have the will to
prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask where you found it?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>The question confused Mrs. Leeds. She began
to stammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;that is, it&rsquo;s none of your affair, Miss
Nichols!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I disagree with you there. I am interested
in seeing Rosanna treated fairly. May I examine
the will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds hesitated and the girls thought
that she would refuse the request. However,
the woman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will permit you to read it if you promise
not to destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Destroying wills isn&rsquo;t in my line,&rdquo; Penny
returned pointedly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds tossed her head angrily. An expression
of bitter hatred which she made no
attempt to hide, came into her eyes. She went
to the living room desk and from a pigeon hole
removed a document which she offered Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, read it for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny inspected the will briefly. Since
neither she nor Rosanna had ever seen Jacob
Winters&rsquo; handwriting it was impossible to tell
if the document had been forged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>To Rosanna&rsquo;s astonishment, she suddenly
seemed to experience a change of attitude regarding
Mrs. Leeds&rsquo; claim to the property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have made a mistake,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged.
&ldquo;This paper seems to give everything to
you, Mrs. Leeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you are coming to your senses at
last, Miss Nichols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Rosanna and I may as well take
our things and leave,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your luggage is ready,&rdquo; the woman said with
satisfaction. &ldquo;Alicia and I packed for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very thoughtful,&rdquo; Penny murmured ironically.
&ldquo;However, I think I&rsquo;ll just run upstairs
and see if anything was missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, you may do that if you like.&rdquo; Now
that she was assured of victory, Mrs. Leeds felt
that she could afford to make slight concessions.</p>
<p>No sooner had the bedroom door closed behind
the two girls than Rosanna faced Penny
with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you really think the will was genuine,
Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, but I decided that probably
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
we could gain our ends best by appearing
to give in to Mrs. Leeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Penny ran her hand under the
pillow of the bed and brought forth the revolver
which she had taken from Max Laponi&rsquo;s
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, what do you intend to do with that
weapon?&rdquo; Rosanna demanded anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not planning on committing
any murders. But it may come in handy
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just told Mrs. Leeds that we would
leave the house immediately,&rdquo; Rosanna reminded
her in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll leave the
grounds. We&rsquo;ll appear to go away, but after
dark we&rsquo;ll sneak back to the entrance of the
tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To watch for the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s my plan. You&rsquo;ll not be afraid to
go with me, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rosanna returned quietly. &ldquo;Only I
can&rsquo;t see what good it will do now. Mrs. Leeds
definitely has the property and anything we
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
learn about the ghost can&rsquo;t alter the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; Penny smiled.</p>
<p>She was so jubilant as they prepared to take
their luggage and leave the house that Mrs.
Leeds regarded her slightly with suspicion.
However, the woman was reassured to see the
girls drive away in their car.</p>
<p>Rosanna and Penny dined early at Andover
but the former ate little. Although she made
every effort to carry on a cheerful conversation
it was obvious to her companion that she was
completely discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; Penny advised optimistically.
&ldquo;I tell you everything will come out right yet.
Even if my own plan fails, there are still lawyers
to be hired. Mrs. Leeds can&rsquo;t take over the
property legally until the court approves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have things fixed up her way,&rdquo; Rosanna
maintained gloomily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no
money to hire a lawyer. I must try to find myself
a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father will help you get one if you need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve accepted so many favors from you already,&rdquo;
Rosanna protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have not!&rdquo; Penny cut in. &ldquo;This trip
to Raven Ridge has been sheer fun for me.
And unless I&rsquo;m mistaken tonight will prove the
most exciting of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; Rosanna shuddered.</p>
<p>She glanced curiously at her companion. She
could not understand Penny&rsquo;s eagerness to return
to the mouth of the tunnel. In her own
opinion the mysterious ghost was none other
than Max Laponi and she had no desire to encounter
him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still want to go through with the
plan?&rdquo; she inquired doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do. I&rsquo;d never feel satisfied if I
left Raven Ridge without solving the mystery.
It&rsquo;s about time we start for the tunnel too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the restaurant, returning to Penny&rsquo;s
car which had been parked outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably our friend the ghost won&rsquo;t put in
an appearance much before midnight,&rdquo; Penny
remarked as they drove slowly toward Raven
Ridge, &ldquo;but it will be wise I think to allow ourselves
plenty of time to find a good hiding place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had grown dark and the girls were pleased
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
to note that heavy clouds would hide the moon
and stars.</p>
<p>Some distance from the Winters&rsquo; house they
parked in a dense thicket near the road. Before
alighting, Penny removed a small package
from the side pocket of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Rosanna asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamite,&rdquo; Penny chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the form of evidence. Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken,
this little package will produce some
startling results!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking in absolute riddles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just be patient and you&rsquo;ll soon know what
I mean,&rdquo; Penny declared teasingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell
you now only it would ruin the surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She locked the automobile and afoot they
quietly stole down a steep winding trail which
led to the entrance of the old mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />The Man in the Boat</h2>
<p>Penny and Rosanna approached the mine
entrance cautiously, fearing that someone
in the vicinity might observe their movements.
However, the place seemed deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rowboat is gone,&rdquo; Penny commented as
she pulled aside a clump of bushes to survey the
spot where it had been hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is! Perhaps the ghost has come and
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope not. That would ruin
everything. Anyway, we&rsquo;ll wait and see. It&rsquo;s
early yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After investigating the shore line thoroughly,
they found an excellent hiding place in a dense
thicket not far from the entrance to the mine.
Then they settled themselves to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Rosanna yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little after nine. We&rsquo;ll have a long
siege of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>The night was cold and damp. Although
both girls had worn sweaters they soon grew uncomfortable
and huddled close together for
warmth. Rosanna tried not to show her nervousness
but even the screech of an owl startled
her. She was aware of every sound and any unusual
movement caused her to grow tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be a wreck long before midnight,&rdquo;
Penny declared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re armed and there&rsquo;s
nothing to fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna made a supreme effort to relax but
it was not until several hours had elapsed that
she began to grow accustomed to her surroundings.
Penny, on the other hand, found it difficult
to remain awake.</p>
<p>At first she riveted her attention upon the lake
but as there was no evidence of a boat, soon lost
interest. For a time she watched the twinkling
lights at Raven Ridge but one by one they disappeared
until the old mansion on the hill was
cloaked in darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the household has gone to bed our
ghost should be starting in on his night&rsquo;s work,&rdquo;
she remarked hopefully to Rosanna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Another half hour dragged by. Still no one
came. Even Rosanna found it increasingly difficult
to fight off drowsiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the ghost is coming tonight,&rdquo;
she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It begins to look that way. But perhaps it&rsquo;s
still too early. Surely it can&rsquo;t be any more than
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems later than that,&rdquo; Rosanna sighed.
&ldquo;My back is nearly broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, from far over the hills,
the girls heard the faint chiming of a town clock.
They counted twelve strokes.</p>
<p>Minutes passed and still there was no sign of
any visitor. At length, Penny arose to stretch
her cramped limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard something just then!&rdquo;
Rosanna whispered tensely.</p>
<p>Penny stood listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I can hear oars dipping in and
out of the water. It must be a boat coming this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peering out through the bushes, the girls surveyed
the lake. It was too dark to distinguish
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
objects but they distinctly could hear the rhythmical
splash made by the moving oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; Penny demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;oh, yes, now I do. It is a boat,
Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s heading right for this spot! Let&rsquo;s
creep a little closer to the opening of the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stealthily they changed positions but remained
well hidden by a screen of bushes.</p>
<p>The boat by this time had drawn into the
tiny cove. However, the night was so dark that
neither of the girls was able to distinguish the
features of the man who crouched in the stern.</p>
<p>He beached the boat and carefully drew it up
into the bushes. Next he lighted a lantern, but
his back was toward the girls and they did not
see his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo; Rosanna whispered.</p>
<p>Penny gripped her companion&rsquo;s hand as a
warning to remain silent.</p>
<p>The man with the lantern looked quickly
about and then moved swiftly into the mouth
of the tunnel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must follow him,&rdquo; Penny urged.</p>
<p>They waited a minute, then noiselessly stole
from their hiding place. As they peered into
the dark mine tunnel they could see a moving
light far ahead.</p>
<p>Fearing that they might lose sight of the man,
the girls hastened their steps. They did not
walk as quietly as they imagined, for soon the
man ahead paused.</p>
<p>With one accord Penny and Rosanna froze
against the tunnel wall.</p>
<p>As the man turned to look back, the light
from the lantern shone full upon his face.</p>
<p>It was Caleb Eckert.</p>
<p>Rosanna and Penny remained flat against the
wall scarcely daring to breathe. Would they
be seen?</p>
<p>Apparently satisfied that no one was behind
him in the tunnel, Caleb turned and walked
slowly on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a narrow escape,&rdquo; Penny whispered.
&ldquo;He nearly saw us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosanna was a trifle shaken. She had not expected
to see Caleb Eckert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected it several days ago but I wasn&rsquo;t
absolutely certain,&rdquo; Penny told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what purpose can he have in playing
such pranks?&rdquo; Rosanna asked in bewilderment.
&ldquo;Caleb seemed rather nice even if he was gruff
and outspoken. I never dreamed he&rsquo;d resort to
anything like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it so hard,&rdquo; Penny advised. &ldquo;He
may have a reason for what he is doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light had disappeared. The girls hurriedly
moved on, fearing that they might lose
sight of the old man entirely. With nothing to
guide them it was difficult to find their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky we explored in the daytime or we&rsquo;d
have trouble following,&rdquo; Rosanna declared.
&ldquo;The ground is so rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she spoke she stubbed her toe on a
rock and would have fallen had not Penny
caught her by the arm.</p>
<p>They came presently to the first flight of stairs
and were relieved to glimpse the lantern far
above them. Taking care to keep out of range
of the beam, they followed through the narrower
passage to the second flight of steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>By this time the girls were positive that Caleb
intended to enter the house by means of the
secret panel. At the risk of detection they drew
a little closer.</p>
<p>Caleb paused at the head of the stairs to listen
for a moment. Then he blew out his lantern.</p>
<p>Sensing that the old man would unlock the
panel, Penny stole forward. She was just in
time to see a section of the wall drop down.
Caleb passed through the opening and with a
click the panel closed behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what shall we do?&rdquo; Rosanna demanded.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re locked in here the same as we were before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I saw the place where he pressed the
wall,&rdquo; Penny whispered. &ldquo;I was watching
closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several minutes she groped about in the
dark. At last her fingers touched a small knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve found it,&rdquo; she proclaimed
triumphantly.</p>
<p>As she was on the verge of turning the knob,
she stayed her hand. With Caleb in the organ
room he would be certain to see the panel open.
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
There was danger too that he might return at
any instant to find them crouching at the head
of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we turn back?&rdquo; Rosanna whispered
nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait until he begins to play the organ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened expectantly. Minutes passed
but not a strain of music did they hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; Penny murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure Caleb is the one who has been disturbing
the household with his ghost music. Why
doesn&rsquo;t he play as he&rsquo;s always done before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both knew that the wall was not soundproof.
For that matter they could hear old
Caleb walking about in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be up to new tricks tonight,&rdquo;
Penny whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be coming back here any minute.
Let&rsquo;s get away before he catches us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was reluctant to leave, for it struck her
that Caleb Eckert had come to the Winters&rsquo;
house for a different purpose than that of his
usual nightly visit. She was curious to learn
what it was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she warned, as they heard a strange
noise from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded like a door closing,&rdquo; Rosanna
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I think it was. Caleb
must have gone out of the room. We&rsquo;ll be safe
in entering now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make certain she listened for a few
minutes but there was no sound of movement
from within. Convinced that the coast was
clear, she groped about for the knob which
opened the panel.</p>
<p>It turned in her hand. She heard a sharp
metallic click, and almost before she was prepared
for it, the panel swung open. It closed
again before either of the girls could recover
from their surprise.</p>
<p>However, Penny turned the knob a second
time and as the section of wall swung back, both
girls stepped through into the room.</p>
<p>As they had expected, it was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose he went?&rdquo; Rosanna
murmured.</p>
<p>They tiptoed to the outside door and softly
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
opened it. The hall was dark. At first they
could distinguish nothing. Then Penny
noticed that the door opening upon the second
floor corridor was ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went downstairs,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
find out what he&rsquo;s up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stairs creaked alarmingly as they crept
down to the second floor. On the landing they
hesitated an instant and were relieved to hear
no unusual sound.</p>
<p>They peered into the long corridor and saw
that it was empty. Caleb was nowhere to be
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he brought another bat for Mrs.
Leeds&rsquo; room,&rdquo; Rosanna suggested, glancing toward
the chamber which the woman shared with
her daughter.</p>
<p>The door, however, was tightly closed. The
one at the other end of the hall which opened
into Max Laponi&rsquo;s room was slightly ajar.
Rosanna and Penny failed to notice.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the lower floor a board
creaked. The two girls moved noiselessly to the
stairway and looked down over the banister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Even Penny was unprepared for the sight
which greeted her eyes. Caleb Eckert was working
at the dials of the living room safe!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />A Daring Theft</h2>
<p>Old Caleb had relighted his lantern
and in its dim yellow glow the girls
could make out every detail of the
center hall and living room. In astonishment
they watched the man spin the tiny dials of the
safe. He manipulated them with a speed and
skill which was amazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I do believe the scoundrel intends to
steal Mr. Winters&rsquo; valuables,&rdquo; Rosanna whispered
with growing anger. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let him
do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one accord they tiptoed down the long
spiral stairway to the center hall. For a minute
they were exposed to view but Caleb was so absorbed
in what he was doing that he did not even
glance up.</p>
<p>Hiding behind a heavy velvet curtain which
partially screened the arched door of the living
room, the girls watched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Twice Caleb tried without success to open
the safe. Although his movements were deft
and sure it was obvious that he had made some
slight mistake in the combination. Each time
he failed he grew more impatient. They could
see his hand shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat it all!&rdquo; they heard him mutter to himself.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right combination. It ought
to open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length the old man&rsquo;s efforts were rewarded.
As he manipulated the dials for the third time
there was a significant click from within the safe.</p>
<p>Chuckling to himself, Caleb turned the
handle and swung open the steel door.</p>
<p>Save for a long metal box, the safe was empty.
In the act of reaching for the container, Caleb
suddenly wheeled.</p>
<p>The girls were startled at the action for they
had heard nothing.</p>
<p>After looking searchingly about the room the
old man apparently was satisfied that he was
alone. With an uneasy laugh he again turned
his attention to the safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m getting a mite jittery,&rdquo; he
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
muttered. &ldquo;I was positive I heard someone behind
me just then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust his hand into the safe and drew out
the box. With fumbling fingers he unfastened
the lid. A smile illuminated his wrinkled face
as he regarded the contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still here, safe and sound. I was a little
afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without finishing, he lifted an object from
the box and held it in the light. It was a tiny
figure made of purest ivory.</p>
<p>Penny and Rosanna exchanged a swift glance.
They knew now that the box contained Jacob
Winters&rsquo; priceless collection of ivory pieces!</p>
<p>After staring at the little figure for a minute
Caleb carefully replaced it and closed the box.
He then locked the safe and returned the oil
painting to its former position on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him now or it will be too late,&rdquo; Rosanna
whispered tensely.</p>
<p>Before Penny could act, there was a slight
movement at the opposite end of the living
room. The girls were horrified to see a closet
door slowly open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Caleb&rsquo;s back was turned. Oblivious of danger
he bent down to pick up his lantern.</p>
<p>From within the closet a man was regarding
Caleb with cold intensity. He held a revolver
in his hand.</p>
<p>Rosanna, terrified at the sight, would have
cried out a warning, had not Penny suddenly
placed her hand over the girl&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Max Laponi, a cynical, cruel smile upon his
angular face, stepped out into the living room,
his revolver trained upon Caleb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged to you for opening the safe,
Mr. Eckert,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;You saved me the
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb wheeled and instinctively thrust the
metal box behind his back. The gesture amused
Laponi. He laughed harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you weren&rsquo;t quite as clever as you
thought you were, Caleb! Hand over the ivories
and be quick about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing but a crook!&rdquo; the old man
cried furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand over the ivories if you value your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of obeying the order, Caleb slowly
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
retreated toward the door. Max Laponi&rsquo;s eyes
narrowed dangerously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to shoot an old man but if you
force me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot,&rdquo; Caleb quavered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give
up the ivory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now you&rsquo;re acting sensibly. Drop
the box on the table and raise your hands above
your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, Caleb complied with the order.</p>
<p>Laponi moved with cat-like tread across the
floor and snatched up the box. With his revolver
still trained on the old man, he backed
toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for a very profitable evening,&rdquo;
he smirked. &ldquo;And when you locate your friend
Mr. Winters&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words ended in a surprised gasp. Something
had struck his right hand a stunning blow.
The weapon fell from his bruised fingers, clattering
to the floor. He felt a cold, hard object
in the small of his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn now,&rdquo; said Penny Nichols.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you to hand over the little box!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />The Tables Turn</h2>
<p>Max Laponi whirled about and
looked directly into the muzzle of
Penny&rsquo;s revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop that box and put up your hands,&rdquo; she
ordered crisply.</p>
<p>Laponi gazed at her jeeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gun isn&rsquo;t loaded,&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know,&rdquo; Penny retorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
your own revolver. I took it from your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression of the crook&rsquo;s face altered for
he well remembered that the weapon had been
left in readiness for instant use.</p>
<p>While keeping Laponi covered, Penny kicked
the other revolver across the floor in Caleb
Eckert&rsquo;s direction. The old man hastily
snatched it up.</p>
<p>Laponi knew then that he did not have a
chance. With a shrug of his shoulders he admitted
defeat. He dropped the metal box on
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the table. Rosanna darted forward and snatched
it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known you&rsquo;d be the one to
ruin things,&rdquo; Laponi said bitterly to Penny. &ldquo;I
was afraid of you from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the compliment,&rdquo; Penny
smiled. &ldquo;Kindly keep your hands up, Mr.
Laponi&mdash;if that&rsquo;s your true name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing but an impostor,&rdquo; Caleb Eckert
broke in angrily. &ldquo;I knew from the moment I
set eyes on him that he was no relative of Jacob
Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine that,&rdquo; Penny returned quietly.
&ldquo;But when explanations are in order, I think
you&rsquo;ll need to clear up a few points yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked confused. However,
before he could answer, footsteps were heard
on the stairs. Mrs. Leeds, wrapped in her bath-robe,
came hurrying into the room. She had
been disturbed by the sound of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny Nichols!&rdquo; she cried furiously. &ldquo;What
are you doing in my house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she noticed the revolver and recoiled
a step.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Mr. Laponi, has this girl lost her senses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently, she has,&rdquo; the man sneered.
&ldquo;She claims I came here to steal that box while
I was only trying to keep Caleb from making
off with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Release Mr. Laponi at once,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds
ordered haughtily. She glared at Caleb. &ldquo;I
always did distrust that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dislike was mutual,&rdquo; Caleb retorted.
&ldquo;You are a grasping, selfish woman and your
daughter is a chip of the old block!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds choked in fury.
&ldquo;Get out of this house, you meddlesome old
man, or I&rsquo;ll have you arrested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was actually enjoying the scene but
now she decided to put an end to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This little farce has gone far enough,&rdquo; she
announced, turning to Caleb. &ldquo;Tell them who
you are, Mr. Eckert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man nodded. Eyeing Mrs. Leeds
with keen satisfaction, he exploded his bomb
shell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Jacob Winters!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Mrs. Leeds gasped in astonishment and even
Max Laponi looked dazed. Of the entire group
only Rosanna appeared pleased. Yet she too recalled
that at times she had spoken with embarrassing
frankness to the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds snapped when
she had recovered from the first shock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
another one of your trumped up stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has no proof,&rdquo; Max Laponi added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he hasn&rsquo;t, I have,&rdquo; Penny interposed. She
took the small package from her dress pocket,
giving it to Rosanna to unwrap for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a photograph!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of you, Mr. Eckert, taken many years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look on the back,&rdquo; Penny directed.</p>
<p>Rosanna turned the picture over and read the
bold scrawl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacob Winters&mdash;on the occasion of his fiftieth
birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the proof I need,&rdquo; Rosanna cried,
her eyes shining. &ldquo;You are my uncle, aren&rsquo;t
you, Mr. Eckert? This isn&rsquo;t another of your
jokes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t a joke this time, Rosanna, although
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
for a time it looked as if the joke would
be on me. And if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Penny
Nichols this scoundrel certainly would have
made off with my ivory collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to pry into your private
affairs,&rdquo; Penny apologized. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have
taken the photograph only I suspected the truth
and needed proof of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well that you did take matters into
your own hands. I guess I botched things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little package of evidence which Penny
had produced contained not only the photograph
but the letter and key which she had found in
Max Laponi&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Penny now directed attention to the signature
appearing at the bottom of the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compare it with the writing on the back of
the photograph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re identical,&rdquo; Rosanna declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Caleb Eckert wrote those letters himself!&rdquo;
Mrs. Leeds cried furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; Caleb acknowledged with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be arrested!&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds fairly
screamed. &ldquo;It was a cruel joke to play. You
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
led us all to believe that we had inherited a
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, why did you write the letters?&rdquo;
Penny inquired. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve not
been able to figure out although I think I might
make an excellent guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb sank down in the nearest chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may as well tell the entire story,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Since my wife died some years ago I have been
a very lonely man. I longed for an agreeable
companion in my old age, someone who would
enjoy traveling with me. My friends were few
for I had spent most of my time abroad. My
only living relatives were unknown to me. I
felt ashamed because I had never looked them
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you decided to become better acquainted,&rdquo;
Penny prompted as Caleb hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I wanted to be liked for myself and
not my fortune. I conceived the plan of sending
out letters inviting my relatives here. I
thought I would subject them to a series of tests
and all the while I could be studying their characters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An insane plan!&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea didn&rsquo;t work the way I expected,&rdquo;
Caleb continued ruefully. &ldquo;I sent out four
letters but two of them were returned unopened
as the individuals to whom they were addressed
were no longer living. However, as you know,
three persons came to Raven Ridge claiming
to have received one of the communications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Laponi must have found the letter and
key which Rosanna lost,&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;He
was the impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it all figured out very nicely,&rdquo; the
crook sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected right off that he was the one,&rdquo;
Caleb went on with his story. &ldquo;I knew I had
no relative answering to his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you send him away at once?&rdquo;
Rosanna questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t very well do that without exposing
my hand. If I admitted my identity then my
little plan would be ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were caught in an awkward position,&rdquo;
Penny smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It kept getting worse all the time. I soon
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
suspected that Laponi was nothing less than a
crook. When I discovered that he knew the
ivory collection was in the house I decided to
remove it from the safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the day I came upon you when you
were trying to open it,&rdquo; Penny recalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Laponi was prowling about the
house and it was my bad luck that he happened
in upon me at exactly the wrong time. Of
course he guessed instantly that the ivories were
locked in the safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, I decided to get rid of him at any
cost. I had a talk with him but even threats
did no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you call in the police?&rdquo; Penny
asked. &ldquo;Surely they would have provided you
with protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I would make one more effort to
get the ivories from the safe. Then if I failed
I intended to admit my identity and send for
help. I might have done it sooner only the
police commissioner and I once had a little
trouble&mdash;nothing serious. It was an argument
over a tract of land. Still, I knew he&rsquo;d enjoy
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
making me look ridiculous if ever he learned
what I had done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pride very nearly cost you a fortune,&rdquo;
Penny commented. She directed her gaze upon
Max Laponi as she questioned: &ldquo;How did you
learn that Mr. Winters kept the ivory collection
in this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to find out,&rdquo; the man jeered.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a hard time proving anything
against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This letter will be evidence enough,&rdquo; Penny
retorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plain case of forgery with intent
to defraud. And then there&rsquo;s the matter of
the will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will wasn&rsquo;t forged,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds cut in
although Penny had not made such a claim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never was a will,&rdquo; Caleb informed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds stared at him. &ldquo;What of the document
I found in the drawer of the desk?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the one you discovered in the
<i>locked</i> drawer,&rdquo; Caleb corrected with a chuckle.
&ldquo;The one that was made out in Rosanna&rsquo;s favor.
That was just another of my little jokes. If you
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
had examined the will closely you would have
noticed that the signature was never witnessed.
It was a fake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the document which I saw you
burn in the fireplace,&rdquo; Penny accused.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds flushed angrily. She realized that
she had trapped herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, how do you explain the will
made out in your favor?&rdquo; Penny probed maliciously.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds turned her gaze upon Laponi for
an instant. Then she said glibly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found the will just as I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t find one made out in your favor,&rdquo;
Caleb contradicted. &ldquo;Because I never wrote
such a document.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look at it,&rdquo; Penny suggested.
&ldquo;Where is the will, Mrs. Leeds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what became of it. I misplaced
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid to produce it,&rdquo; Penny challenged.</p>
<p>Rosanna had been looking through the desk.
She now triumphantly brought to light the
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
paper which Mrs. Leeds had claimed to be Jacob
Winters&rsquo; last will and testament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never wrote a line of it,&rdquo; Caleb declared as
he examined the document. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a forgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgery is a serious offense, Mrs. Leeds,&rdquo;
Penny remarked significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; the woman cried nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect we&rsquo;ll have to send you to jail along
with Laponi here,&rdquo; Caleb cackled.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds did not realize that he was only
baiting her. She began to tremble with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send me to jail,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; Laponi cut in sharply.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds whirled upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that because you want me to take
all the blame! Well, I won&rsquo;t do it. You forged
that will yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your suggestion, Mrs. Leeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my suggestion. I&rsquo;d never have considered
such a thing if you hadn&rsquo;t put the idea
into my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You burned the first will which you believed
to be genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I did. But I never forged anything
in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was because you were afraid you&rsquo;d be
caught,&rdquo; Laponi sneered. &ldquo;You wanted someone
else to take the rap for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tricked me,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds accused. &ldquo;If
I had known you intended to rob Mr. Winters
of his ivories I should have had nothing to do
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you thought it wasn&rsquo;t robbery
when you decided to cheat Rosanna Winters out
of her inheritance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had no inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you thought she did. No, Mrs. Leeds
you paid me well to forge the will in your favor.
You&rsquo;re involved every bit as deeply as I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds collapsed into a chair and burying
her face in her hands began to sob.</p>
<p>Penny felt a little sorry for her, realizing that
at heart the woman was not a criminal. She had
been goaded on by an overpowering ambition
to improve her social position by gaining Jacob
Winters&rsquo; fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well call the police,&rdquo; Penny said
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
after a slight hesitation. She had noticed that
Laponi was casting cunning glances about the
room and guessed that he was hoping for an opportunity
to escape.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeds sprang to her feet. She darted
over to Jacob Winters, grasping him by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, please don&rsquo;t have me arrested. I
didn&rsquo;t mean to do wrong. For the sake of my
daughter let me go free. After all, we are relatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we are,&rdquo; he agreed. Turning
to Rosanna, he said quietly: &ldquo;It is for you
to decide, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go free,&rdquo; Rosanna urged instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that is best,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;But as
far as Max Laponi is concerned we can&rsquo;t get
him to the lock-up soon enough to please me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll guard him I&rsquo;ll telephone for the
police,&rdquo; Penny offered.</p>
<p>Leaving the old man with both revolvers she
went into an adjoining room to place the call.</p>
<p>No sooner had she disappeared than Max
Laponi saw his opportunity to escape. For an
instant Jacob Winters&rsquo; attention wavered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>That instant was enough for Laponi. Seizing
the metal box which Rosanna had replaced upon
the table, he darted out through the doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />A Break for Freedom</h2>
<p>Max Laponi bolted across the center
hall, flinging open the outside door.
He looked directly into the face of
Christopher Nichols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s the big hurry?&rdquo; the detective
demanded, grasping him firmly by the arm.</p>
<p>Laponi tried to jerk free but he was no match
for the detective.</p>
<p>By this time Penny and the others had come
streaming into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him get away!&rdquo; Penny cried.</p>
<p>As the crook struggled to escape, Mr. Nichols
slipped a pair of handcuffs over the man&rsquo;s wrists.
Recovering the metal box he handed it to his
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, how did you get here?&rdquo; she asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>The detective did not hear for he was regarding
Laponi with keen interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, if it isn&rsquo;t my old friend Leo Corley.
Or possibly you have a new alias by this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He calls himself Max Laponi,&rdquo; Penny informed.
&ldquo;Is he a known criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well known, Penny. He&rsquo;s wanted in
three states for forgery, blackmail and robbery.
His latest escapade was to steal a diamond ring
from the Bresham Department Store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you did get my wire?&rdquo; Penny cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what brought me here. After I
received it I got busy right off and with the information
you furnished it was easy to look up
this man&rsquo;s record. The police have been after
him for months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t waste any time coming here,&rdquo;
Penny smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you girls might be in more
danger than you realized. Max here isn&rsquo;t such
a nice companion. By the way what&rsquo;s in the
box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny opened it to reveal Mr. Winters&rsquo; fine
collection of ivory. The detective whistled in
awe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would have been a nice haul, Max,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Too bad we had to spoil your little
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that kid of yours I&rsquo;d have
gotten away with it,&rdquo; the crook growled. &ldquo;I was
dumb not to suspect she was the daughter of
a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well cough up the diamond
ring,&rdquo; Mr. Nichols advised. &ldquo;It will save an
unpleasant search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a shrug of his shoulders, Laponi took
the gem from an inner pocket and gave it to the
detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start for the station?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;We may as well get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already called the police,&rdquo; Penny told
her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t have long to wait.&rdquo; He
shoved Laponi toward a chair. &ldquo;May as well
make yourself comfortable until the wagon gets
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your kindness overwhelms me,&rdquo; the crook
returned with exaggerated politeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get wind that Mr. Winters&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
ivories were kept in the house?&rdquo; the detective
inquired curiously.</p>
<p>Although the crook had refused to answer
the same questions a few minutes before, he
was now willing to talk, knowing that his last
chance for escape had been cut off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read an item in the paper some months
ago,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;It was a little news story
to the effect that Jacob Winters had recently
purchased several new pieces for his collection
and that he intended to build special exhibit
cases in his house as a means of displaying them.
I clipped the item and forgot about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one day I chanced to pick up a letter
which someone had dropped. It contained a
key to this house. I decided it was too good an
opportunity to miss. Posing as Jacob Winters&rsquo;
nephew I came here to look over the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never had a nephew,&rdquo; Mr. Winters declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the first mistake I made. The
second was in underestimating the ability of
Penny Nichols. I thought she was only a school
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>Penny smiled broadly as she inquired:
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you enter into an agreement with Mrs.
Leeds to defraud Rosanna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forged the will for her if that&rsquo;s what you
mean. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in getting any of the
money myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was because you knew it couldn&rsquo;t be
done,&rdquo; the detective interposed. &ldquo;You considered
the ivory collection more profitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you forged the letter stating that
Jacob Winters had been buried at sea,&rdquo; Penny
mentioned.</p>
<p>With a nod of his head, the man acknowledged
the charge. It was Christopher Nichols&rsquo;
turn to ask a question. Penny&rsquo;s letters had
mentioned the mysterious mansion ghost and
he was deeply interested in the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you were the ghost, Max?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob Winters answered for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the ghost. It was part of my joke to
frighten the occupants of this house. Not a
very good joke, I&rsquo;ll admit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were the one who put bats in my
room,&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds accused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a garter snake in your bed which
you never found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mr. Eckert, your ghostly pranks
included playing the organ,&rdquo; Penny smiled. &ldquo;I
suspected it when I learned Jacob Winters had
been a talented musician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I built the pipe organ into the house before
my wife died,&rdquo; Mr. Winters explained. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t used it a great deal in recent years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us about the tunnel,&rdquo;
Rosanna reminded him. &ldquo;How did you happen
to construct it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. The lower branch of the passage
was an old mine tunnel. The mine closed down
forty years or so ago. The upper passage which
connects with the house was built by my grandfather.
This house, you know, has been in the
Winters&rsquo; family for generations. And I hope,
upon my death, that it will pass on to another
by the same name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked significantly at Rosanna as he
spoke.</p>
<p>Before the conversation could be continued,
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
the police car drove up to the door. Max
Laponi was loaded in and taken away. Mr.
Nichols went with the police, promising to
return to the Winters&rsquo; house as soon as he
could.</p>
<p>After the commotion had subsided, Jacob
Winters turned severely to Mrs. Leeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you, madam, kindly pack your things
and leave this house at once. I never want to
see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t even daylight yet. Alicia, poor
child, is sleeping&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake her up. I&rsquo;ll give you just an hour to
get out of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hard, cruel, old man!&rdquo; Mrs. Leeds
cried bitterly, but she hurried up the stairs to
obey his command.</p>
<p>After the woman had disappeared, Rosanna
picked up her sweater which she had dropped
on a chair. She turned toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there,&rdquo; Jacob called. &ldquo;Where are
you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just leaving. You told Mrs. Leeds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not Mrs. Leeds, are you?&rdquo; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
old man snapped. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing, I want you
to stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;indefinitely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you think you could stand to live
with me. I&rsquo;m cross and I like things done my
own way, but if you could put up with me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could put up with you!&rdquo; Rosanna ran to
him and flung her arms about him. &ldquo;Why, I
think you&rsquo;re a darling! I was afraid to tell
you so for fear you&rsquo;d believe I was after your
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money! Fiddlesticks!&rdquo; Jacob sniffed. He
wiped a tear from his eye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try
to make up to you for all that you&rsquo;ve missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two had a great deal to say to each other,
but presently they remembered Penny. She
had been watching the little scene with eager
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be able to thank you,&rdquo; Rosanna
declared happily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re responsible for
everything, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d permit me to reward you in a
substantial way,&rdquo; Mr. Winters added.</p>
<p>Penny smilingly shook her head. &ldquo;It was fun
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
coming here to Raven Ridge. But it would ruin
everything if I accepted pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you&rsquo;ll stay a few days longer,&rdquo; Mr.
Winters urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Father will agree to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Nichols returned from police
headquarters another pleasant surprise was in
store for Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if you&rsquo;ve won the reward which
the Bresham Store offered for the capture of
Laponi,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn it down,&rdquo; Rosanna urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;In fact, I know
just how I&rsquo;ll use that money when I get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; her father inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy myself a new car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps you&rsquo;d use it to go into
business in competition with me,&rdquo; he teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll solve a mystery which will be
so big and important that you&rsquo;ll not be able to
twit me about it,&rdquo; Penny announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t really teasing, my dear. I think you
did a fine bit of work this time and I&rsquo;m proud
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly,&rdquo; Mr. Nichols repeated, smiling
broadly. &ldquo;And I predict that you&rsquo;re only starting
on this career of crime detection which you
find so very thrilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could be sure of that,&rdquo; Penny sighed.</p>
<p>With all her heart she longed for another adventure
as exciting as the one she had experienced.
Although she had no way of knowing
what the future held, she was destined soon
to have her wish gratified. In the third volume
of the Penny Nichols&rsquo; series, entitled, &ldquo;The
Secret of the Black Imp,&rdquo; she encounters a
mystery more baffling than any she has previously
solved.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Leeds and her daughter left the
house, the others took Mr. Nichols for a tour of
the secret passageway. Jacob Winters explained
in detail how the panel operated and entertained
them by playing several selections on the pipe
organ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love music,&rdquo; Rosanna remarked wistfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even had an opportunity to learn
to play the piano.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have it now,&rdquo; he assured her.</p>
<p>Mr. Nichols remained during the day but
late in the afternoon he was forced to start for
home as his work had been neglected. He was
very willing, however, that Penny should remain
as long as she wished at the old mansion.</p>
<p>The days were all too short for the two girls
who enjoyed rambling through the woods, rowing
and swimming in the lake, and exploring
every nook and cranny of the interesting old
house. But at length the time came when
Penny too was obliged to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back and see us often, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Rosanna urged as they parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever I can,&rdquo; Penny promised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had a glorious time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drove away, but at the bend in the road
halted the car to glance back. The house,
cloaked in the shadows of evening, looked nearly
as mysterious as upon the occasion of her first
visit. However, to her it would never again
have a fearful aspect.</p>
<p>Jacob Winters and his niece stood framed in
the doorway. They waved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Penny returned the salute. Then regretfully
she turned her back upon Raven Ridge and
drove slowly down the mountain road which
led home.</p>
